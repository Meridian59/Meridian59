; profane.txt : Base version of profanity filter data.
; To convert to profane.dat, just rename it, then run Meridian once to encrypt.
; This plainly human-readable form with comments is not sent to customers.
;
;;;;;;;;;;
;
; To add a profane term, say 'heck', add a line below:
;    +heck
;
; To remove a profane term, say 'darn', add a line below:
;    -darn
;
; Only letters are valid in profane terms.  A huge number of non-letter varieties
; and tactics are also found and filtered automatically for any listed term, so
; don't worry about spaces or punctuation in the terms listed here.
;
; All terms are found even if they are part of larger words, so take care not to add
; default terms that aren't truly vile.  For example, 'ass' would not be a good term,
; because (1) it's not that bad alone (it just means donkey), and (2) 'ass' appears
; in normal words like 'assimilate' and 'compass'.
;
; (If we didn't make the filter find portions of words, we wouldn't find 'heckhead'
; if 'heck' were a listed profane term.  That would be too easy to circumvent.)
