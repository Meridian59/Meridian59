VISUAL STUDIO INTEGRATION

This directory contains a .sln and .vcxproj files for assisting in 
building, running, and debugging through Visual Studio 2022. It is an 
optional method for building the game separate from calling the nmake 
command. VS integration directly calls those same underlying make files,
so this should be practically identical.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

The code has been built successfully with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
Community Edition, which you can download for free at 
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

1. Open the Meridian 59.sln file

2. Press 'F7' to Build, or 'F5' to Build and Run

RUN INSTRUCTIONS

See the main 'README' file for how to run the client and create an 
administrator account and character. Otherwise, pressing "F5" from 
within Visual Studio will run the client.
