    This document explains the various ways the game checks for
    cheating..
    <h2>General Information</h2>
    Almost all cheating detection shows up in the debug log and begins
    with
    the word "ALERT!" in all capitals.
    <p>In general, we prefer to detect people instead of simply stopping
      them.&nbsp; Players that try to abuse the system one way are most
      likely
      the same people willing to abuse the system in other ways.&nbsp;
      In
      addition, some fixes are imperfect.&nbsp; If we simply stopped
      people
      from using the cheat, they would keep working until they found out
      how
      they can use the cheat without being stopped.&nbsp; For example,
      even
      though Half-Life has a way to detect the speedhack, some people
      have
      figured out that if you don't use the speed boost all the time you
      can
      avoid detection.</p>
    <h4>Log Limitaions and how to reset them.</h4>
    <b>Note:</b> The system will only generally track 25 suspected
    problems.&nbsp; This is to prevent the debug log from overflowing
    with
    alerts from a blatant cheater.
    <p>An admin can reset the logging restrictions on a player so that a
      player that has hit the maximum logging can continue to be
      logged.&nbsp;
      One way is to manually reset the <i>piCheaterLogs</i> value in a
      player.&nbsp; The other way is to send the message <i>ResetCheaterLogs</i>
      to the player object.&nbsp; To do this globally for all players
      you can
      issue the command:<i>send class user ResetCheaterLogs</i> in the
      admin
      window or server console.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Speedhack Detection</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    Speedhack is a program that allows people to move faster than they
    should.&nbsp; As far as I understand it, the program tricks the
    computer
    and client into thinking it is running slower than it really
    is.&nbsp;
    The client uses the computer's timing to limit movement, so it tries
    to
    speed up movement since it thinks it is running slower.&nbsp; Since
    the
    computer is really running at normal speed, this results in super
    speed
    for the character.
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    The Meridian 59 client sends a movement update once per
    second.&nbsp; A
    client affected by speedhack sends many more updates per
    second.&nbsp;
    In addition, the speedhacker travels faster than normal, obviously.
    <p>Our first layer of defense is to check for movement
      packets.&nbsp;
      As stated, we should get one movement packet per second, even in
      lag.&nbsp; This means that if the user sends more than one packet
      per
      second, they are probably cheating.&nbsp; The game allows the
      player to
      send 2 more packets than the duration of movement should expect;
      this
      is
      to allow for some leeway for strange cases of a player lagging a
      lot.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The second layer of defnese is to detect large movements without
      the
      corresponding lag in reporting movements.&nbsp; If a player moves
      a
      large distance and it wasn't enough time since the previous
      movement
      message, then the player may have teleported in the room.&nbsp;
      The
      game
      considers that a <a href="#squareddistance">squared distance</a>
      of&nbsp; 200 or more with the previous message happening less than
      3
      seconds ago as worthy of flagging.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that we ignore any movement that happens between
      rooms.&nbsp;
      So, if a player ends up in a different room than the original,
      there
      will be no message.</p>
    <p>Also, DMs and above will never be checked.&nbsp; Due to their
      teleportation powers, they would regularly trip the detection
      mechanism.</p>
    <p>The game does not do anything about speedhackers due to the
      complexity of trying to stop them, not wanting to give them a
      "test"
      harness to test alterations to the code, and the likelyhood of
      punishing
      false positives. </p>
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    There are two messages for detecting speedhack use.&nbsp; Note that
    the
    examples below may not be exactly as what would show up in the
    game.&nbsp; For example, line numbers may change with edits.&nbsp;
    Also,
    the coordinates and RIDs used may reflect not actual game
    information.
    <p>The first message detects too many movement packets sent on
      average.<br>
    </p>
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 2 2003 02:14:50|[user.bof (2461)] ALERT! ,GriEf
        PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6845, is moving too fast.&nbsp; Has
        moves
        count
        of 3, Possible speedhacker.<br>
      </tt></p>
    The line indicates how many more packets on average they have
    sent.&nbsp; In this case, they have sent 3 more packets than the
    number
    of seconds they have been moving.&nbsp; A probable speedhacker. <br>
    <br>
    The second message detects speedhack movement that is above and
    beyond
    what is expected for the short delay since last update..<br>
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 2 2003 04:14:55|[user.bof (2481)] ALERT! ,GriEf
        PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6845, moved ,221, with only ,1, seconds
        since
        last movement update.</tt><br>
      <tt>Mar&nbsp; 2 2003 04:14:55|[user.bof (2482)] Additional: ,GriEf
        PkeR!, went from (,2,15,) to (,12,15,) in RID ,951, Possible
        speedhacker.<br>
      </tt></p>
    <p>The first line provides the information needed in a
      nutshell.&nbsp;
      It provides the name and account/object info of the suspected
      cheater.&nbsp; It shows the <a href="#squareddistance">squared
        distance</a>
      the character moved as well as the time since the last movement
      update.&nbsp; In this case, someone moved about three times as
      fast as
      they should have moved in one second.&nbsp; Note that this message
      should not print if the user ends up in the blink position in the
      room
      (i.e., has probably just finished casting the "blink" spell.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>The second line provides more information that can be used to see
      if
      the person really is a cheater.&nbsp; This includes the starting
      and
      ending (row, column) pairs and which RID (by number) the move
      happened
      in.&nbsp; This allows administrators to check to see if this would
      be
      normally possible due to special conditions in the room, the
      player
      ending up in the safe teleport coordinates (an indication they
      blinked
      or were teleported there for some reason).<br>
    </p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span>&nbsp; Currently, the
    move
    packet tracking is giving many false positives.&nbsp; For now, this
    tracking is not trustworthy.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, this is not an exact science.&nbsp; The code can only
    detect what it is told and sometimes flukes happen.&nbsp; False
    positives, times when a player is detected as cheating when they
    most
    likely are not, exist and must be watched for.<br>
    <p>As mentioned above, any movement that happens between rooms is
      ignored, which cuts down on some false positives.&nbsp; All
      notifications are for movement made in a single room.</p>
    <p>There are certain instances when the cleint sends more than one
      update per second as part of the game. These include times when
      the
      player walks over active items, like firewalls and lightning walls
      and
      the hotplates in guild halls.&nbsp; Also, hitting the space bar
      frequently will send more frequent move updates.&nbsp; A player in
      these
      situations may trigger the detection mechanism even though they
      might
      not be cheating.&nbsp; The movement counter should compensate for
      these
      situations and not give a false high value in most cases.&nbsp;
      Wall
      spells have caused problems in the past, so be aware of this
      situation.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A good administrator should check for special conditions in the
      teleport checks.&nbsp; Blinking will almost always set it off.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In general, a player that has a lot of log entries in a very
      short
      period of time has a higher probability of being a cheater than
      the
      player that sets off the detection a few times over a long period
      of
      time.&nbsp; It is recommended that you take user complaints into
      account
      if there is any doubt if a player is cheating.</p>
    <h3>Other Information</h3>
    <h4><a name="squareddistance"></a><b>Squared Distance:</b></h4>
    We use squared distances because they are easy to calculate.&nbsp;
    We
    use the Pythagorean theorm to detect this.&nbsp; So, if a player
    moves
    from (old row, old col) to (new row, new col), we can find the
    squared
    distance between the points as:
    <p>((old row - new row) * (old row - new row)) + ((old col - new
      col) *
      (old col - new col))</p>
    <p>Taking a square root is a very expensive operation, so we just
      use
      the squared distance.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Running without Vigor</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    There is a program that tricks the client into running, even though
    their vigor is too low.&nbsp; Previously, this was only checked on
    the
    client side.<br>
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    We check to see if the client sent a higher speed value than is
    allowed
    by vigor.&nbsp; If the player is trying to "run" without the proper
    vigor, then we flag it.&nbsp; The player is also moved back to the
    previous location they were at when they tried to run without vigor.<br>
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    There is only one message associated with this detection:
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 2 2002 10:56:27|[user.bof (4684)] ALERT! Player
        ,GriEf
        PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6856, was running with no vigor.</tt> </p>
    <p>It gives player name and account/object information.&nbsp; Pretty
      simple. </p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    I fear that there may be cases where lag will prevent a client from
    being properly updated with the amount of vigor a player has but
    would
    still allow a player to run.&nbsp; This has not been properly
    tested,
    but it should be kept in mind.&nbsp; If this message is repeated
    many
    times in rapid order, it is probably a strong indication of a
    cheater
    (since the server is getting updates, the client is probably getting
    the
    proper updates as well).<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Attacking or casting spells on targets "behind" the player<br>
    </h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    There is a program that allows the player to attack or cast a spell
    at
    any object within the room, even if it is not in the view of the
    client.<br>
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    The game already checked for range for the weapon or spell, so that
    is
    not a concern.&nbsp; However, the server relied on the client for
    the
    "field of view" of the player, and what they could hit.&nbsp; The
    program allows people to hit targets that were not in the client
    graphic
    window's view.<br>
    <br>
    "Behind" the player is defined as behind the line defined by the
    cardinal and in-between directions that are the closest to being
    perpendicular to the player's direction vector.&nbsp; For example,
    if
    the player is facing mostly east, then the cardinal direction
    direction
    line runs north/south; in essense, anything that is further west
    than
    the layer is "behind" him or her.&nbsp; The more interesting cases
    are
    when the player is facing one of the corner directions.&nbsp; The
    code
    calculates the equation of the line using the point-slope formula
    and
    determines which side of the line the target is.&nbsp; The target
    must
    also be at least 1 unit away from the player in order to be
    considered
    behind the user.<br>
    <br>
    The server sends a message that appears to be the default "not in
    view"
    message that the client gives if you try to attack something that's
    not
    in view.<br>
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    There is only one message associated with this detection:
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 2 2002 10:56:27|[player.bof (3810)] ALERT! Player
        ,GriEf PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6856, at [,34,25,] and angle ,0,
        tried
        to hit ,Victim,ACCOUNT 665 OBJECT 31029, at [,34,20,] that was
        behind
        them.</tt> </p>
    <p>It gives player name and account/object information and the
      object
      targetted.&nbsp; We also give the coordinates and the angle of the
      attacker.&nbsp; Angle in Meridian are as follows:&nbsp; Due East
      is
      angle 0, and every 90 degrees is another 1024 angle units going
      clockwise.&nbsp; Therefore, due south is 1024, and southwest is
      1536.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    There seems to be a good number of false positives generated by the
    movement lag
    between the client and the server's positions.&nbsp; This does not
    look
    to be a reliable way to find cheaters without further verification.<br>
    <h3>Other information</h3>
    The game penalizes any attack or spell on a target that is not
    considered in visible range.&nbsp; Currently, the game makes spells
    fizzle or attacks miss 2/3rds of the time if the target is behind a
    wall.&nbsp; This is in response to people casting spells on targets
    from
    across town.&nbsp; Note that this also hinders "safe spots" that
    players
    stand at in order to avoid being hit by enemies.&nbsp; This behavior
    cannot be completely shut down because of the way players move on
    fine
    coordinates and monsters move on the large coordinates, plus the
    fact
    that room information does not take movable sectors into
    consideration
    for calculating line of sight.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Forced Offer Detection</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    There is a program that exploits the Windows foundation of the
    client
    and allows people to use normally disabled buttons and
    messages.&nbsp;
    Using this program, people were able to force an offer to be
    finished
    without the other person accepting the initial offer.&nbsp; This
    meant
    that they could force people to take harmful items, such as the
    amulet
    of shadows, without consent.
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    We check to see if a player tries to finish an offer without the
    other
    player accepting the offer.&nbsp; We accomplish this by flags in the
    user object.
    <p>Once the other person accepts the offer by making a counter
      offer, a
      flag is set in the original offerer's user.&nbsp; If this flag is
      NOT
      set when the original player tries to finish the offer, the offer
      is
      cancelled and not completed.&nbsp; We then write a notice to the
      debug
      log.</p>
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    There is only one message associated with this detection:
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 2 2002 10:56:27|[user.bof (4684)] ALERT! Player
        ,GriEf
        PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6856, tried complete an offer without
        the
        other
        person accepting.</tt> </p>
    <p>It gives player name and account/object information.&nbsp; Pretty
      simple. </p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    There is no chance for a false positive, barring the possibility of
    bugs in the detection code.&nbsp; Anyone that is caught by this code
    is
    most likely a cheater.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Forced Globe Posting Detection</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    Using a program similar to the forced offer detection, players can
    post
    on globes they would not normally be allowed to.&nbsp; Even though
    this
    leaves a telltale message as to who did it, we still log the
    infraction
    for later use.
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    We do a double-check for permissions before we allow the article to
    be
    written.&nbsp; The game stops any unauthorized posting from going
    on.
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    <b>Note</b>: The detection code is currently NOT working, even
    though
    posts are stopped.
    <p>There is only one message associated with this detection:</p>
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 1 2002 11:36:21|[news.bof (107)] ALERT! Player
        ,GriEf
        PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6856, tried to write to a newsglobe
        without
        permission.</tt></p>
    <p>It gives player name and account/object information.</p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    There is no chance for a false positive, barring the possibility of
    bugs in the detection code.&nbsp; Anyone that is caught by this code
    is
    almost certainly a cheater.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Bad Characters in Character Bios</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    An old trick.&nbsp; A player tries to trick the server's profanity
    filter into overloading by using repeated non-standard
    characters.&nbsp;
    Enough of these characters would lag the server, and too many of
    them
    would crash it entirely.
    <p><b>Note</b>:&nbsp; The server side profanity filter is currently
      disabled. </p>
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    The client detects if the person tries to set their bio with all the
    characters.&nbsp; It then sends a "broadcast" message to the server
    that
    contains a sequence of color codes that is impossible for the client
    to
    send under normal circumstances.
    <p>In order to prevent people from flooding the logs, we limit the
      number of logs to 10.&nbsp; Note that this uses the same log count
      as
      the speedhack system above.</p>
    <p>The client blocks these changes from happening.</p>
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    There are a few messages that deal with this cheat, depending on the
    serverity
    <p>The first one is for people that use a small number of
      characters,
      generally in order to just lag the server instead of crash it.</p>
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 3 2002 01:06:06|[user.bof (3346)] ALERT! ,GriEf
        PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6856, used more than 20 bad chars in
        their
        bio.&nbsp; Watch for multiple occurrences.</tt></p>
    <p>It gives player name and account/object information and a
      notification of the number of bad characters.</p>
    <p>The second message if for more flagrant abusers.</p>
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 3 2002 01:09:26|[user.bof (3351)] ALERT! ,GriEf
        PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6856, used more than 50 bad chars in
        their bio.</tt></p>
    <p>Again, it gives player name and account/object information and a
      notification of the number of bad characters.</p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    There is no chance for a false positive, barring the possibility of
    bugs in the detection code.&nbsp; I did not write this code myself,
    so
    I
    do not know the accuracy of it.&nbsp; Anyone that is caught by this
    code
    is almost certainly a cheater, however.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Distance Trading With Players and NPCs</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    Using a cheat program players were able to trick the client into
    thinking that some random item was a particular NPC.&nbsp; Players
    could
    interact with the NPC as normal, offering them items for sale.&nbsp;
    This was rather convenient for some players, as they could go to
    hard-to-reach areas and not have to return for quite some time.
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    We simply detect if the NPC's owner and the player's owner are the
    same.&nbsp; If not, we flag the interaction.&nbsp; The interaction
    is
    also stopped without success.
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    There are three messages for this, one for offering to NPCs, one for
    buying from NPCs, and one for offering to players..
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 3 2002 01:06:06|[monster.bof (1891)] ALERT! ,GriEf

    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 3 2002 01:26:06|[user.bof (4424)] ALERT! ,GriEf

        ,GriEf
        MUlE!,ACCOUNT 314, object 7841, in distant RID, 828</tt></p>
    <p>It gives player name and account/object information, which NPC or
      player they tried to interact with, and the RID of the room they
      were
      in.</p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    There have been a few detections of players offering to other
    players
    in adjacent rooms. &nbsp;This could be from players having an offer
    window open while going to another zone.&nbsp; Players flagged with
    this
    message are most likely cheaters if they are not in adjacent zones..<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Distance Trading With Chests<br>
    </h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    Similar to distance trading with players, &nbsp;some cheaters can
    make
    the client think an object is a distant chest to store items in.
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    We detect if the player's owner is the same as the chests's true
    owner
    since the server knows the true location of both. &nbsp;If the
    owners
    are not the same, then the system flags the user and disallows the
    transaction.
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    There are two messages for this, one for taking from, and one for
    putting stuff into chests..

      </tt></p>
    <tt>The messages show the user and the room IDs of the cheater and
      the
      chest.<br>
    </tt>
    <p><tt></tt></p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    As with distant trades with players, there may be a few false
    positives. &nbsp;Check for adjacent room IDs. &nbsp;Otherwise, any
    player flagged with this message is most likely cheating.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Putting Objects Directly into Player Inventories</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    By tricking the client, the cheater makes the game think that an
    object
    is a player with the same attributes as a chest. &nbsp;In other
    words,
    the cheater can put objects directly into the player's inventory
    without
    the regular offer checks.
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    We check to see if the object that the player is putting stuff into
    is
    actually a Player. &nbsp;If so, we flag them and disallow the
    transaction.
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    There is only one message associated with this detection:
    <p><tt>Mar&nbsp; 2 2002 10:56:27|[user.bof (3215)]
        ALERT!&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><tt>GriEf
        PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6856,</tt><tt> tried to 'put' items
        into
        player
        ,Innocent Victim,Account 101 OBJECT 1343<br>
      </tt></p>
    <p>The message gives information about the cheater and the target or
      victim.</p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    There is no chance for a false positive, barring the possibility of
    bugs in the detection code.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Duping<br>
    </h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    Using a cheat, players were able to duplicate any Number Item (also
    called "stacked items").&nbsp; They were able to trick the client
    into
    offering the same object twice by altering memory addresses.&nbsp;
    Due
    to the way the server handled number items the game would add the
    number of the stack to another stack twice, effectively doubling the
    stack.&nbsp; This is most commonly used on money since it has no
    weight.<br>
    <h3>What do we detect and how does the game react?</h3>
    We detect if a player tries to offer&nbsp; the same item or put the
    same item into a chest multiple times.&nbsp; This is done every
    offer
    or "put" command.<br>
    <h3>What do the detection messages look like?</h3>
    There are three messages for this:<br>
    <p><tt>Sep 11 2004 21:26:44|[user.bof (4687)] ALERT! ,GriEf
        PkeR!,ACCOUNT 313 OBJECT 6856, tried to offer a duplicate item

        a chest.</tt></p>
    <p>It gives player name and account/object information, which NPC or
      player they tried to interact with, and the RID of the room they
      were
      in.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>What about false positives?</h3>
    There should not be false positives for this detection, barring bugs
    in
    the detection code.<br>
