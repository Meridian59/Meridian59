    This document is intended to describe the important administrative
    commands and features of the Blakserv (Meridian 59) server.<br>
    <h2>Shutting down Meridian 59</h2>
    The fastest way to shut down Meridian 59 is to:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Send the users a notification.&nbsp; (At the server console:
        send users ~BServer shutting down in 5 minutes.)</li>
      <li>Save then shut down the game.&nbsp; (At the server console:
        terminate save)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    This will save the game then immediately shut down the server.&nbsp;
    It is advisable to give the players some time (usually 30 minutes)
    to put things in order before shutting down the server.&nbsp; All
    game state is saved, including quests that could expire while the
    player is offline.&nbsp; In most cases, players should NOT be
    affected by logoff ghost penalties if you shut down the game like
    this.<br>
    <h2>The Maintenance Port</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    The maintenance port is a special port you can connect to and send
    administrative commands to. This is very useful for integrating a
    billing system with the server.<br>
    <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
    Using the maintenance port requires 2 steps to establish the
    security of the connection. Both steps involve editing the
    blakserv.cfg on the server.<br>
    <br>
    If you edit the blakserv.cfg file, you will notice that under the
    [Socket] header, you have 2 important keys:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">[Socket]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">MaintenancePort&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      5959</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">MaintenanceMask&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      65.194.80.144;</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">65.194.80.145</span><br>
    <br>
    The "MaintenancePort" is the port the maintenance system listens to.
    By default, this is 9998. In our example, we're using 5959.<br>
    <br>
    The "MaintenanceMask" are the IP numbers from which we can take
    messages. This is to provide a layer of security since the
    maintenance port does not require a login. Note that different IP
    numbers can be listed if separated with a semicolon (;). Up to 15 IP
    numbers can be specified this way.<br>
    <br>
    Note that changing either of these values requires a restart of the
    server.<br>
    <br>
    Once this has been done, you can simply open a connection to the
    server on this port from one of the trusted IP numbers specified.
    You send administrative commands in plain text; note that you could
    open a telnet connection to the server and send commands that way if
    desired (for testing, for example). A full list of administrative
    commands appears later in this document. Note that not all
    administrative commands are available via the administrative port,
    again for security reasons.<br>
    <h3>Special notes<br>
    </h3>
    There are two special error messages return via the mainteance port.
    The first is "Help is unavailable through maintenance mode."
    &nbsp;This message can appear if you try to use the <span
      style="font-style: italic;">help</span> command, or if you send
    only part of a proper command. The second message is "You do not
    have access to this command." &nbsp;This is sent if you try to use a
    command that cannot be used via the maintenance port.<br>
    <h2>Administrator Commands</h2>
    These are the basic commands that can be used to administrate the
    servers. These commands can be entered in the "Administration" pane
    of the server, via admin window control in the game, or by
    mainteance port (if allowed). &nbsp;Sample output is shown so you
    can see normal messages and parse them for expected information.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> If you are entering the commands
      via the server console or an admin window</span><span
      style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> you can type "help" for
    information about the commands. Typing part of a command will result
    in getting additional help about that command, including parameter
    information.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Command:</span> create automated
    &lt;account name&gt; &lt;password&gt;<span style="font-weight:
      bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters: </span><br>
    &lt;account name&gt; is a string that should be used for the account
    name. <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> This should not
    contain just numbers.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    &lt;password&gt; is the initial password to be assigned to the
    account.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</span> Creates a user
    account with 1 user object associated with it.<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Available by Maintenance Port?</span>
    Yes<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample output:</span> <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">create automated test.account
      1234</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;"> Created account 23.<br>
      &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">
      23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7354 User&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User2355399544</span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments:</span> This should be the
    the default function used to create accounts to save on
    communication. It is recommended that you allow each account to have
    2 character objects, so use the "create character" command found
    below. The second line of output shows the account number, the user
    object number (which can change), the type of character created
    (User), and the default name assigned to the character by the
    system.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Command:</span> create account
    &lt;type&gt; &lt;account name&gt; &lt;password&gt;<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters: <br>
    </span>&lt;type&gt; indicates the type of account: user, DM, or
    Admin.<br>
    &lt;account name&gt; is a string that should be used for the account
    name. <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> This should not
    contain just numbers.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    &lt;password&gt; is the initial password to be assigned to the
    account.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</span> Creates an account
    with no character objects associated with it.<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Available by Maintenance Port?</span>
    NO.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample output:</span> <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">create account admin
      test.admin 4321</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">Created ACCOUNT 24.</span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments:</span> This is the way to
    create accounts above the user level. Note that the account
    determines the greatest amount of control allowed to a character.
    Therefore, a User account with a DM character will restrict the DM
    to user-level access; the DM will be unable to use any special
    client commands (those that start with "dm"), for example. Likewise,
    a User object on a DM-level account will look and behave just like a
    normal User character.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Command:</span> create
    &lt;character type&gt; &lt;account number&gt;<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters: <br>
    </span>&lt;character type&gt; indicates the type of character: user,
    DM, or Admin.<br>
    &lt;account number&gt; is the number of the account you wish to add
    the character to.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</span> Creates a character
    object and associates it with the specified account.<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Available by Maintenance Port?</span>
    Yes, but only for Users. You cannot create DMs or Admins via the
    maintenance port.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample output:</span> <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">create user 24</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">Acct Object&nbsp;
      Class&nbsp;&nbsp; Name</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      7368 User&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User2456202510</span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments:</span> This is the way to
    create additional user character objects. Note that the account
    determines the greatest amount of control allowed to a character.
    Therefore, a User account with a DM character will restrict the DM
    to User-level access; the DM will be unable to use any special
    client commands (those that start with "dm"), for example. Likewise,
    a User object on a DM-level account will look and behave just like a
    normal User character. The second line of output shows the account
    number, the user object number (which can change), the type of
    character created (User), and the default name assigned to the
    character by the system.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Command:</span> delete account
    &lt;account number&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters: <br>
    </span>&lt;account number&gt; is the number of the account you wish
    to delete.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</span> Deletes an account
    from the server.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Available by Maintenance Port?</span>
    Yes.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample output:</span> <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">delete account 24</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">Account 24 will be deleted.</span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments:</span> This is how you
    permanently delete an account from the server. <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: Once deleted, an account cannot
      be restored automatically. </span>Make sure you really want to
    delete an account before you do so. It is recommended that you
    suspend accounts that are no longer used for a long time (99999
    hours is a good value). A suspension allows a user to come back to
    the game easier in the future. Meridian 59 currently does not
    recycle account numbers, so that numbers associated with deleted
    accounts will not be reused.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Command:</span> suspend account
    &lt;duration&gt; &lt;account number&gt;<span style="font-weight:
      bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters: <br>
    </span>&lt;duration&gt; is the number of hours to suspend an
    account.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
        bold;"></span><br>
    </span>&lt;account number&gt; is the number of the account you wish
    to suspend.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</span> Temporarily
    suspends an account for a number of hours.<span style="font-weight:
      bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Available by Maintenance Port?</span>
    Yes.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample output:</span> <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">suspend account 99999 23</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">Account 23 (test.account) is
      suspended until Jul&nbsp; 9 2014 17:46:42.</span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments:</span> This is the
    recommended way to disable an account of a customer cancelling the
    account. A duration of 99,999 hours is over 10 years, which should
    suffice. Shorter durations can be used as punishment for repeat
    offenders or at the request of a user that needs to focus on offline
    activities for a few days. A user that is suspended will be
    immediately logged off, so you do not need to send additional
    commands to disconnect them. Note that the duration of the
    suspension duration comes first, be careful not to suspend the wrong
    account! &nbsp;Also note that time added is <span
      style="text-decoration: underline;">cumulative</span>, so that a
    suspension of 24 hours plus 48 hours is a total suspension of 72
    hours. &nbsp;Accounts cannot be suspended beyond January 18, 2038
    (the timestamp could cause an integer overflow error). &nbsp;The
    server catches small additions beyond this date, but very large
    numbers (such as 999,999, for example) can cause previously
    suspended accounts to become unsuspended.<span style="font-weight:
      bold;"></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Command:</span> unsuspend account
    &lt;account number&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters: <br>
    </span>&lt;account number&gt; is the number of the account you wish
    to unsuspend.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose:</span> Unsuspends an
    account.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Available by Maintenance Port?</span>
    Yes.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample output:</span> <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;"> unsuspend account 23</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;"> Account 23 (test.account) is
      unsuspended.<br>
    </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments:</span> This will
    eliminate all the suspension time that was remaining.<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Command:</span> set account object
    &lt;account number&gt; &lt;character object number&gt;<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters: <br>
    </span>&lt;account number&gt; is the number of the account you wish
    to own the new character object.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&lt;character object
    number&gt; object number of the character you wish to move to the
    new account..<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:
      bold;">Purpose:</span> Moves a character object from one account
    to another.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Available by Maintenance Port?</span>
    Yes.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample output:</span> <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">set account object 23 7299</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">Removing user object 7299 from
      the old account 23.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">Associated account 23 with
      object 7299 as a user.</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Comments:</span> This command is not
    recommended to be used with the maintenance port, since character
    object numbers can and often do change during system saves.<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Command:</span> show account

    admin account with only 1 character that is also suspended for 99999
    hours. Note that the "Suspended" location is blank on the normal
    account. Also note that an admin account as an "A" after the account
    number in the first line. DM accounts will likewise have a "D" in
    that location. The "Credits" column is a historical relic from the
    original concept behind the game. This does show the cumulative time
    the account has been logged on. Each hundredth of a credit is one
    second, so the admin above has been logged on 25081 seconds total,
    which is just shy of 7 hours.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments:</span> Shuts down the
    server completely. &nbsp;Note that there is no way to restart the
    server via admin commands, since the server must be online to accept
    commands! &nbsp;Also, the message show above does not appear until
    the game is done saving, which can take several minutes.
    <h2>The Accounts File</h2>
    <h3>What is it?<br>
    </h3>
    The accounts file is a file that lists all the accounts on the
    server, and can be parsed to compare against external records. This
    is one of the files saved to the hard drive when the server saves
    the game.<br>
    <br>
    The file is found in "game\accounts.*" in the server installation.
    The extension of the file is the timestamp of when it was saved. The
    server writes a new file every save cycle, so you should look for
    the most recent file. Note that any change in the accounts since
    last server save will NOT be reflected in the file.<br>
    <h3>What is the format?<br>
    </h3>
    A file could look like this:<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">ACCOUNT
      1:Chris.Kirmse:0:1:0:0:0</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">ACCOUNT
      2:Andrew.Kirmse:0:1:0:0:0</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">ACCOUNT
      3:green.b:0:1:1044852942:25081:0</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">ACCOUNT
      4:ellis.r:0:1:1044645282:57235:0</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">ACCOUNT
      5:ellis.c:0:1:1043870283:10124:</span><span
      style="font-family: monospace;">1404953660</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">NEXT_ACCOUNT_ID 6</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
    You'll notice each line is a separate account, with information
    separated by colons (:).<br>
    <br>
    First column is the word "ACCOUNT", then the account number.<br>
    Second column is the account name.<br>
    Third column is the encrypted password. (Ignore the similarities
    shown above, this was taken from an internal server that uses
    default passwords.)<br>
    Fourth column is the account permission level. 0 for user, 1 for
    admin, 2 for DM.<br>
    Fifth column is last login timestamp.<br>
    Sixth column is the number of seconds spent online by this account.
    &nbsp;This is the same as the "credits" amount indicated above.<br>
    Last column indicates the timestamp of when the account will be
    unsuspended. In most cases, this is 0 for users that not currently
    suspended. However, if an account has passed it's unsuspension time
    and the user has not logged on since then, this will still show a
    non-zero value. Since this is a timestamp, you could compare it to
    current time, assuming the times are synchronized (or fairly close).<br>
