<h3><i>Synopsis of the Gods</i></h3>
<p><b>Shal'ille </b>- Shal'ille is primarily known as the Goddess of
Good, and her followers are Healers, devoted to healing and curing the
afflicted, helping newbies, and combatting evil wherever it may rear
it's ugly head. Shal'ille also is known as being one with nature - the
calm and tranquil side of nature (bubbling brooks, trees rustling in a
gentle breeze, soothing rain, etc). <br>
Temple: RID_TEMPLE<br>
Surnames: the Calm, the Rain<br>
Suggested Symbol: the Ankh</p>
<p><b>Faren </b>- Faren is all about wildness and chaos. He is the
unpredictable, the odd ball, what you cannot count on, and his
followers in particular embrace the violent side of nature,
particularly storms, disasters, and the ocean in general. His followers
are battlemages, leaning towards raw power, either applied in terms of
direct damage, or in the form of spells as likely to hurt you as your
opponent.<br>
Temple: RID_BADLAND1<br>
Surname: the Storm<br>

<p><b>Qor </b>- Qor is about evil, and she followers tend to be
Necromancers and Player Killers. She embraces death, and calls upon her
followers to 'bring the good (players) into her kingdom'. The spells
she offers tend to be potent anti-player spells with a high cost.<br>

<p><b>Kraanan </b>- Kraanan is about the principled side of war -
weaponcraft, soldiering and strategy. He also has been known to dabble
in politics, and seems genuinely interested any time that mortals match
wits or skills against each other. His followers are enchanters, who
believe that the path to victory is to 'build a better warrior'. They
also have the strongest anti-magic magic, used for levelling the
battlefield to their advantage.<br>

<p><b>Riija</b> - Riija is the trickster god, long thought dead,
certainly known to be AWOL. Few practice his magiks anymore, but his
strength has always been in the realm of powerful illusions that are
almost as real as reality itself. <br>
Temple: RID_RIIJA_TEMPLE<br>
Surname: the Fool<br>
Suggested Symbol: The Eye</p>
<p><b>Jala</b> - Jala is the goddess of the arts, and of love, and her
followers will be quick to point out that the two are hopelessly
intertwined. She is the epitome of beauty, trust, truth and naivete.<br>
Jala is, the myths say, dead, and yet some of her spells, powerful
songs which affect the rules of the world, are rumored to still exist.<br>
Temple: none<br>
Surname: the Song.<br>
Suggested Symbol: the Note</p>
