<TR>
<TD>He has spent many years in retreat in the surrounding mountains, and
now devotes all of his time to stone carving. Afiera D'xor is a master
artisan who carves intricate designs suggesting infinity and mathematical
perfection, images that wrap around themselves in endless repetition. He
is also sought out by travelers who hope to share some of the wisdom he
has gained from a life of meditation and solitude. He is very old and slightly
hunched, and his wiry frame give away the hidden strength he possesses
only when he is at work with his hammer and chisel. Dressed in the comfortable,
warm, and utilitarian garb of the mountain people. He looks very weathered,
and it is said of him that he has an understanding of the spirit of Jala
that goes far beyond what anyone perceives.</TD>
