<P>This sickly man stares at you with bleary eyes from behind the counter.
His breathing is somewhat labored and sweat mattes his forehead. Frisconar
is almost as well known for his keen interest in magical reagents as he
is for his dour out look on life.</P>

<P><B>BACK&nbsp;STORY</B></P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Keenly interested in magical reagents, he owes his lively hood to the
princess and those that learn the spells of the gods. He also blames all
of the gods for the problems of the world. Frisconar is a hypochondriac,
desperately trying to garnish attention by expounding on his ills (real
and imaginary). Frisconar used to have a fairly serious relationship with
Madelia the Barloque Tailor until she ended it. He still desperately tries
to catch her attention and is sometimes used by her when she has need of
magical reagents.</TD>
