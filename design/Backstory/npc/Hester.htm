<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Hester is old and quite small, from a very distant land. She is incredibly
adept with her fingers, and the quality of the clothing she produces is
very good. She is secretive about her past, and is quiet and attentive
toward her customers. She lives above her shop in a small apartment, and
ocassionally there are strange comings and goings of quiet people at all
hours, but nothing that has alerted the reasonable suspicions of anyone
but the busybodies around Cor Noth. But busybodies will be busybodies,
and the rumors about who comes and goes and why vary as widely as a coven
of illegal magicians who gather to focus their dark powers, to an enchanted
room where every fantasy can exist. In actuality, and in what will eventually
be eluded to, she is a political and religious refugee from somewhere in
her secret past, and will ocassionally use her basement as a stop in a
mysterious underground of people moving about Meridian that remain unseen,
and unknowable.</TD>
