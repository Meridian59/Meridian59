<P>This female Avar has been exiled from her society for her illegal magic
practices. At least that’s the common belief, although it is difficult

<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Although the various Avar societies on the Island are factionalized,
involved in a prolonged civil war, and can't agree on much of anything,
there is one thing that all the Avars understand. The Bone Priestess is
stark, raving mad. And she is. The Bone Priestess is a female Avar who
is in permanent exile from the various Avar societies on Konima's Island,
living in isolation on the north shore. She has been visited upon by demons
(the illusionary magic of the manipulative Riija Monk included) and is
convinced that she has shamanistic powers, even though she was not born
with the mutations to be included in this sect. It is impossible to ascertain
whether her rituals, totems, fire pits, and skull and bone structures are
indeed conjuring any arcane energy, because she is completely insane. •
Bone Priestess supplies the fourth piece of the Quest. </TD>
