<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>This becoming, young woman appears as cold and curt to new faces. Despite
that, it is obvious to all that her true passion lies in crafting fine
bows. Years ago, so she says, her father was exiled from the settlement
for his irrational devotion to following Riija and the ways of the woods.
Now, he is too old or tired to help those who seek the temple of Riija,
so she begrudgingly does his duties (see temple quest). She explains that
he is too sick to come out from his room (and scolds anyone who tries the
inner door), does the quest requirement, then gets back to her woodworking.
Curiously, another NPC will claim that her father has been dead for years.
