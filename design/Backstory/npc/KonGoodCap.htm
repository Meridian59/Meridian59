<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>This is the highest ranking officer who attends to the day to day tasks
of soldiering rather than the strategic and political ambitions of the
Generals in the Konimas Army, which in a militaristic society is a very
powerful position. There are two Captains of the Guard, that alternate
shifts at the main gate to the city regulating the flow of people and materials
between The Settlement and the enemies of The State outside. What passes
this checkpoint depends a lot on who you talk to. The good Captain is the
well-educated son of a very rich and influential merchant family, who has
risen rapidly to this prestigious position through hard work, intelligence,
and adhering to the rules. He is doubtlessly being groomed for a position
on the General Staff. He is fair, and has compassion for the men that he
leads, and indeed has earned the respect of many common soldiers, and most
of the civilian community. He is well mannered, tall, athletic and muscled,
in his early thirties. He wears the impeccable uniform of a career military
officer, and has the no-nonsense, crisp personality to match. </TD>
