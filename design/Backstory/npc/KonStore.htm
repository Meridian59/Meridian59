<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>This small and somewhat scattered man runs what at first glance looks
like an immense scrap heap formed into a maze. with walls to partially
support it. Think of a very cluttered garage, multiply the amount of junk
by three, and undercoat the place with a layer of dust and soot as thick
as a dime. The manager has a remarkable system of organization though,
and there are some real gems buried in this shop. His pricing structure
is erratic, and his approach to business not very salesman-like. He seems
to empathize with every item in the shop, and is maybe a bit sorry to make
a sale at all. Middle aged, librarian-like. • Will sell a variety of equipment
for adventuring </TD>
