<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>A remarkable man fallen upon a very rough life, the Master of the Trading
Post was born on the Meridian mainland and raised in the persecuted secret
society of the last Riija school magicians. This underground community
was being hunted down and annihilated, and as the last living practitioner
he fled his successful business and political position as he could, banking
his life on the gamble of a legendary island where Riija flourished. He
now lives outside of every group on the Island running a neutral, fortified
trading post near the Avar village where Avar traders, human smugglers,
rival warriors and outlaws of every description meet. He speaks fluently
the Avar, Konimas, and Meridian tongue and is adept at the Riija magic,
as well as being tough enough to earn an enforced neutrality for his tavern/inn/post.
But he's not teaching anybody anything, or telling one one-millionth of
what he knows. Large, heavyset man, late middle aged. His appearance could
be thought of as a somewhat soiled nobility; intelligence and power corrupted
by suspicion and the brutality of survival. • Tavern, inn, and store functions
• Supplies the third piece of the Quest </TD>
