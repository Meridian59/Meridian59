<TR>
<TD>Paddock realizes he runs the most popular tavern in the world. He is
both cocky and friendly. To keep the bar alive, he has become known as
quite a rumor monger, spreading tales about everything and everyone though
he tries to keep a positive spin on everything. The only thing Paddock
will speak poorly of is Barloque. He does not consider the other inns to
be a threat to his business. Paddock might be played by Harvey Keitel.</TD>
