<TR>
<TD>Parrin is widely known in Meridian, but rarely spoken of favorably.
He is a widely traveled bard, and one with an extremely gifted set of hands,
but his songs, particularly his lyrics, tend to provoke groans of disgust.
They tend towards the inane, with the only glimpse of true 'cleverness'
being in occasional puns so bad that one's first reaction is to throw something
at the bard. Parrin seems to wear the groans as a badge of pride. Parrin
travels from inn to inn to tavern to tavern (avoiding Tova, who threatened
to kill him if he ever set foot in his inn again, although no one knows
why). He also has been known to visit both the Duke's chambers and the
Princess' castle. Parrin has learned a new trick of late, and that is including
names of PCs in his songs, slipping the names of PCs who have killed the
yeti, raided guild halls, visited the island or performed other heroic
acts into his act. If you give him a tip, he may even force your name into
a song, although whether or not you'll be pleased by the result is another
story. Give him a particularly large tip, and he may play his only popular
song, a whimsical tune about an island, far far away. Parrin is a short,
thin, sandy hair man in his mid twenties who wears smarmy silk clothes.
