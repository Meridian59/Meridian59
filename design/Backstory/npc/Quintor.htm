<TR>
<TD>A quiet, brooding man who keeps to himself. Years ago, before the mines
shut down he was quite successful fabricating mining tools and was happily
married to a beautiful young woman from Jasper. Quintor was in the process
of building a nice life for himself when the mines bottomed out and his
world came crashing down around him. His business dried up overnight, and
his young bride left for greener pastures with on of the departing mine
executives. Quintor was devastated, and for a town and a people that shows
little of itself to the outside world, he uncharacteristically cried and
grieved and screamed her name for months. In the midst of his despair he
turned his angst into his work, dedicating himself to superhuman efforts
with fire and iron. He could be heard screaming and groaning through many
days and nights at his forge. It is said that after Quintor made his first
blade, which you can still see up in his shop, he mysteriously left town
for three months and then just as mysteriously reappeared one morning,
and a peace seemed to have settled over him. He hung the blade up on the
wall, and never mentioned his wife again. Quintor truly came into his own
when he switched to forging weapons to keep his shop and spirits alive.
Even now he works very hard at his trade and is widely recognized as the
finest weapon maker in Meridian. He produces weapons in limited numbers
and is very proud of his work. If a player walks into his shop with a weapon
that he made, he will recognize the weapon immediately. He has the jet
black, full hair is that is characteristic of people from Jasper, but is
bearded and tall, and very thin. He wears a wool cap and a thick leather
vest over his shirt. He lives at the inn, and stays away from the local
squabbles and gossip. Although no one ever asked him for an alibi for the
morning Qesino disappeared, a couple people seem to remember that he was
away hunting in the mountains at the time. But that's not the kind of thing
that anyone should be talking about, the good people of Jasper know that
it is always better to let sleeping dogs lie. </TD>
