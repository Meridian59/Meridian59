<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Rook is a nobleman with a fanatical loyalty to the Princess. So much
so, in fact, that it drove him out of the Court, for his temper would always
get the best of him if he felt a slight to his honor or that of the Princess,
and he would duel. As the practice of dueling is strictly forbidden in
the Royal Court, he eventually became awkward to the Princess faction and
was sent away. He has set up in Cor Noth and dedicated his vast knowledge
of weapon skills and tactics to commercial ends. His obsession with the
Princess, despite his exile from favor, has not diminished a bit. As a
young man, his father was a general under the King, and Rook received the
finest military education possible. He served as a career officer in the
King's Army, and proved to be a critical figure to the Kingdom during numerous
wars, courageous, brave, and brilliant on the battlefield. The problem
was/is, during peacetime he is something of an embarrassment, as he is
quite extreme. Dressed in the finery of a nobleman, Rook has a trim shorter
than average figure, and a grand mustache. Rook holds his fellow citizens
of Cor Noth in contempt for what he feels are their liberal, tolerant views.
Ironically, it is because of these same tolerant views that Cor Noth is
the only settlement in Meridian that would accept Rook. But he is hard-nosed
and vain. It is commonly known that Rook sees his fighting academy as only
a past time, and at times he seems very indifferent to the whole thing.
He is waiting for the time that his Princess needs him again, and he anxiously
awaits the messenger that calls him to her cause.</TD>
