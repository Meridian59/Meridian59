<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>The younger and less competent brother of Paddock, who has always bailed
him out of trouble in the past. He admires his brothers stature, but would
rather avoid the work. To this end, he has sucked up to the Duke and now
works in the posh and often closed Ball Room of the Blackstone Keep. Now
living an easy life, he lets his professionalism go as he becomes tipsy
during parties. He has some of the best court gossip but isn’t smart enough
to use it to his favor. Even still, he still envies the respect his brother
gets.</TD>
