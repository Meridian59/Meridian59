<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>City Clerk in North Barloque</FONT></I></P>

<P>Not your typical Royal bureaucrat. She's attractive, charming, and by
all accounts, honorable. Caramo has spent years counting the Duke's money,
filing the former Queen's taxation scrolls, and more recently, serving
as clerk for the Office of the Justicar.</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Saidi is a bright young woman brimming with sex appeal. With long legs,
a revealing yet officious outfit and gentle smile, she is sure to win the
affections of many men. Her goals are to learn as much as she can about
the ways of common law and one day teach in the University of Cor Noth.
At present she tries to be as helpful as she can to the current Justicar,
knowing that their references could help her gain a permanent place at
the University. Although she enjoys the attention her looks gain her, she
wants to hold out for a man who will appreciate her when she becomes a
scholar. (Because of the function of Saidi, she will be called the &quot;city
clerk&quot; as a character name, just like the watcher)</TD>
