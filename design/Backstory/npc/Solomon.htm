<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Solomon has fine and exotic taste in goods, as his shop in this multicultural
trading city reflects. He has collected goods and art from travelers from
every corner of the known worlds, and is rumored to have artifacts and
relics from even beyond that. He is interested in hearing tales, and is
very well traveled himself, although it would be impossible to say just
where he might be from. If you were to hang around his shop for a couple
days, you would hear more languages spoken there than you could identify,
yet Solomon seems comfortable conversing, haggling, and joking around in
all of them. Solomon is in his early forties, and dresses richly in exotic
clothes. He offers a cup of tea to customers that look as though they might
have a story to tell. He has a very relaxing presence, as he is confident
and comfortable. He also has a couple of apartments above his shop that
he will rent out as they become available.</TD>
