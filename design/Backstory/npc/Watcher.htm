<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>The 20 year old son of Priestess Qerti地ya and the councilor Cylill,
Cort the Watcher thoroughly enjoys his post. Wars have become somewhat
unreal to him as he watches game after game, though he does hope to help
every person reach their potential in case the Orcs invade his beloved
town. He was appointed to this position by the Duke as a favor to his mother.
Note he is relatively new to his position. </TD>
