<TD>Yevitan is very old, and a very shrewd businessman. Although in his
old age he runs the Royal Bank in Jasper (which is owned by the Duke) as
a younger man he was summoned to the capitol and eventually became the
Financial Minister for King Zarcos V. Despite being an outsider from the
circles of nobility (no person from Jasper would ever be considered more
than a stranger to be wary of to the 'nobility') his intelligence allowed
him to become very close to the King, and crucial to his reign. Yevitan
became very powerful, both politically and financially. But when the King
died Yevitans' umbrella of protection died with him, and his political
enemies (which were many) banished him from power and stripped him of his
lands. If the Duke had not intervened, he would have been executed as well.
But the Duke felt that he might be useful as long as he could keep him
relatively out of sight of his enemies, and the perfect opportunity presented
itself. The Duke sent Yevitan back to his home town of Jasper on a business
venture, to start a bank and take advantage of the then booming mines.
A good move on the Dukes' part, because he knew full well that the people
of Jasper would never accept an outsider that tried to do business there,
and a good move for Yevitan because he kept his head. But that doesn't
necessarily mean that Yevitan is ingratiated to the Duke, in fact he has
no loyalty to him at all. In his view his salvation was strictly a business
transaction, a debt which Yevitan has now paid in full. In the past decade
since the closing of the mines, the bank has ceased to be an important
asset to the Duke, and Yevitan is all but forgotten in Royal circles. But
while keeping a low profile, Yevitan has plenty of time to do some thinking
of his own, and has managed to amass another fortune. Now he's waiting
for the perfect time, and he'll make his move to raise an army and take
power. His political views are much more conservative than the Dukes',
he believe that there must be a monarch at ANY price, although he knows
that King isn't the position he would hold in the new court. He is always
quietly looking for a candidate, and awaiting the time to strike. He is
spry for being an elderly man, short and slightly plump.</TD>
