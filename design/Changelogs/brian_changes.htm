    <h1>Brian's New Changes</h1>
    This document is to chronicle the gameplay and other changes made to
    the game.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Changes to the Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10/26/06
        <ul>
          <li>Lowered the weapon chance to hit modifier for high-end
            types (thrusting) from 175 to 150. </li>
          <li>Increased the weapon damage range for high-end types
            (slashing) from 4-9 to 5-11. </li>
          <li>Lowered the weapon chance to disarm modifier for high-end
            types (thrusting) from 20 to 10. </li>
          <li>Lowered the weapon spell penalty modifier for low-end
            types (slashing) from -30 to -15. That is, they will
            penalize spellcasting less. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/28/06
        <ul>
          <li>Added MailingList object to game. It's an object
            containing a list of player objects which can be sent as a
            reference to the client when it parses mail names. This is
            used for the new feature of sending a mail to
            "guildofficer", which will send an email to all officers in
            the guild. Upon parsing the name, the User object will
            create a MailingList object and fill it with a list of the
            guild officers. The MailingList object deletes itself after
            the mail has been sent. It might be good to have an object
            store the mailing list object to prevent oddities like
            someone sending mail right before a save cycle. In theory,
            you could use this object to send a mail to any list of
            players (or admins). </li>
          <li>Added message GetOfficers to Guild object. Returns a list
            of objects for the officers of the guild. This is used by
            MailingList to create a list for mailing the guild officers.
          </li>
          <li>Changed the function UserLookupEachName in User. If the
            name is "guildofficer", it uses the MailingList object and
            fills it with a list of the officers in the guild. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/6/06
        <ul>
          <li>Changed wall elements so that they won't affect a person
            if they have not moved yet. This should reduce the instances
            of newbies getting fried to a crisp by firewalls outside
            town doors. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/11/04
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed major bug in Distill causing potions to have very
            low spellpower. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/11/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed multi-cast spells to be castable on Sacred Haven
            by default. </li>
          <li>Changed Hunt to be non-offensive in Sacred Haven. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/2/04
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed RID_MAR_CRYPT2 to have a simpler check for statues
            remaining. Also got rid of unused boss statue code. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/31/04
        <ul>
          <li><b>Patched the live servers.</b> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/17/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Jewel of Froz to use mana when boosting a spell's
            damage. It takes 1 mana per jewel if only one is wielded, 2
            mana per jewel if two are wielded (total of 4). Adds a
            random(1,2) damage if the user has no mana (normally
            random(3,5)). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/28/04
        <ul>
          <li>Added a 3 second post-cast timer to Truce. Should help
            address the problem with Truce mules. </li>
          <li>Fixed it so that Feign Death sends lighting information
            properly. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/23/04
        <ul>
          <li>Sharpened the code for who Reflections will attack. They
            will not attack other reflections of the same original or
            the original. Decreased hatred to -100 (was -25). </li>
          <li> <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/13/04
        <ul>
          <li>Added in check for people offering duplicate objects. This
            is a bug that causes dupe problems. </li>
          <li>Changed FixMoney in System to call FixMoney in the Money
            class, which caps the amount of each money object. This will
            require less operations to cap the money supply. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/12/04
        <ul>
          <li>Made DM spells not checked when checking to see if a
            helpful spell is being cast upon an outlaw/murderer. </li>
          <li>Fixed bug with Distill not working. By default, spells
            that can't be made into an item return $ instead of FALSE. </li>
          <li>Made Foresight an outlaw/harmful spell. Fits better with
            the new rules on helping outlaws/murderers. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/28/04
        <ul>
          <li><b>Patched the live servers!</b> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/24/04
        <ul>
          <li>Adjusted Battered Skeleton treasure table (skel2t) to
            include less weapons, more light scrolls. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/16/04
        <ul>
          <li>Added a 600 ms casting time to Anti-Magic Aura. Prevents
            the spell from being cast repeatedly by holding down the
            hotkey. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/7/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that the Tos watcher will not give away a
            blank admin that teleports into the arena. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/2/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed spell so that Spellbane affects monster casting,
            too. Always stops monster casting, unless monster cannot be
            silenced. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/1/04
        <ul>
          <li>Made the Spider Queen a harder by mildly increasing level
            (hit points) to 165 (was 150) and difficulty to 9 (was 5).
            Also removed the vulnerability to non-magical weapons (!?!).
            Should put a bit more challenge into the encounter, making
            it more like a "boss" encounter. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/29/04
        <ul>
          <li>Doubled the rate of vigor regeneration that resting gives
            you. This gives newbies a little boost in their killing,
            since at higher levels players will still eat in order to
            keep their regen high. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that helpful casting spells on an outlaw or
            murderer is an outlaw offense. The player's safety will
            catch this and give a warning. Also made it so that angeled
            characters cannot cast upon outlaws or murderers. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that Dispel Illusion has a percentage chance
            to dispel each illusion, instead of working 100% of the
            time. Room illusions (such as the entrance to the Orc Caves)
            will be dispelled 100% of the time. Immortal admins will
            have the spell be 100% effective. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that spells like Dement and Anti-Magic Aura
            reduce chance for monsters to cast spells proportional to
            base instead of by adding absolute values. </li>
          <li>Changed Dark Angels and Xeochicatl to use the spell
            casting infrastructure in Monster superclass. This means
            they will be affected by dement, AMA, and mana bomb as are
            other spellcasters. </li>
          <li>Changed number of treasure items dropped and increased
            maximum possible number of items dropped. Forumula is now
            based on both level and difficulty (was level and a random
            factor before). In general, low level monsters will drop a
            more even number of items (usually 1), but higher level and
            difficulty monsters have a greater chance of dropping more
            items. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/28/04
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed it so that the rest threshold will not go above 10
            if Second Wind is in effect, even if set externally (such as
            by dropping a held token). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/26/04
        <ul>
          <li>Added new Jala level 6 spell, Crystalize Mana. Creates a
            mana crystal which can be used later to replenish mana. </li>
          <li>Created new "mana crystal" object to go along with the new
            Crystalize Mana spell. </li>
          <li>Adjusted Nodeburst to lowergain to double base increase
            based on spellpower (was previously triple). Also made it so
            that player gained mana based on gain instead of current
            mana. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/25/04
        <ul>
          <li>Moved all the wall spells to be under a single superclass.
          </li>
          <li>Made wall spells double-check for maximum number of
            summoned objects in room after trance as well as before
            casting. </li>
          <li>Reduced casting time on Poison Fog to 2 seconds (was 5
            seconds). Now matches fog's casting time. </li>
          <li>Elminated casting time on Ring of Flames (was 1 second). </li>
          <li>Renamed wall element and wall spell files to be more
            consistent with their class names. </li>
          <li>Removed Line of Sight limitations for melee weapons. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that Room will not reset a default NO_COMBAT
            flag during a frenzy. This was happening with Truce in
            Marion when the spell ended. </li>
          <li>Changed Spell to exclude invalid targets in the Arena when
            constructing the list of valid targets. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/17/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Evil Twin to be uncastable on someone who is
            morphed. Reports were that Evil Twin conflicted with a Morph
            spell enchantment on the target. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/15/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Mirth to act as an attack modifier. It gives a
            small bonus (+100) to-hit and a moderate random bonus (1-5)
            to damage vs. evil targets. </li>
          <li>Changed Melancholy to act as an attack modifier. It gives
            a small bonus (+100) to-hit and a moderate random bonus
            (1-5) to damage vs. good targets. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/13/04
        <ul>
          <li>Added "dm hidden" command which allows Admins to remove
            themselves from the "who" list of mortals. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/8/04
        <ul>
          <li>Edited the letter sent to players that have just lost
            their guardian angel, giving a bit more information
            including information about Justicar elections. </li>
          <li>Removed ability to Morph into a Stone Troll, too many
            exploits were caused by blending unblendable translations
            and going completely invisible. </li>
          <li>Fixed shrines. Removed the base +25 bonus spellpower they
            automatically gave to all spells. Shrines now properly give
            a bonus to spellpower based on their dedication. </li>
          <li>Added in list of bonus spellpower for spells in System,
            settable by admins for events, such as God's days, etc. </li>
          <li>Added in message to mana nodes GetLocationName, to get the
            name of the location where the node ususally is. This is
            useful for nodes that disappear such as the fey node. </li>
          <li>Increased an Apparition's hit points by double. It divides
            the total hit points by 5 instead of by 10. </li>
          <li>Fixed Island shrine to actually work properly! Was being
            deleted previously, so the state change was not being saved.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/7/04
        <ul>
          <li>Added notification system to Caramo for when Justicar
            voting starts. It will notify people online when voting
            starts, or it will notify people when they log on during a
            vote. </li>
          <li>Added sign to the Barloque court room with information
            about voting and signing up or opting out of notifications.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/5/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Caramo so that she will not start a new vote if
            the current Justicar is removed from office (usually through
            suicide or becoming an outlaw/murderer). This is to prevent
            an abuse where people would make a mule become an outlaw
            after using all the pardons in order to force a new vote to
            get more pardons. </li>
          <li>Changed Caramo so she will not allow a second pardon of a
            murderer during a term. </li>
          <li>Changed Mystic Touch to transfer at least 1 mana. Also
            made the minimum amount of mana needed to cast the spell
            equal to casting cost + 5. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that logging off with negative
            enchantment(s) will add 3 seconds to the total duration of
            each enchantment. This will prevent players from "flashing"
            (logging online and offline quickly) in order to wear down a
            negative enchantment without presenting a viable attack
            target. </li>
          <li>Changed Lore object's sorting algorithm for lists. It is
            now a bit more efficient, requiring only O(n) comparisons
            when inserting an element instead of O(n^2). Also changed it
            so that if someone advances and they are equal in score to
            someone else, they'll be promoted ahead of someone else
            withthe same score. This means that people that newly reach
            the maximum number of points for a statue will replace
            existing statue holders. This gives the new players
            something to aim for. </li>
          <li>Changed Purge spell to allow casting on self (without
            outlaw status) on Sacred Haven. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/30/04
        <ul>
          <li>Added a defense bonus to Invisibility. Now gives (25 +
            spellpower) bonus defense. </li>
          <li>Increased Magic Shield's base defense to 50 (was 25). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/28/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that a player holding a token cannot attack.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/23/04
        <ul>
          <li>Adjusted weights and bulks on weapons to fall in line with
            their descriptions. Biggest changes were to make scimitars
            heavier and Riija swords lighter. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/17/04
        <ul>
          <li>Removed randomized element to Fade's duration. Seems
            reasonable given the concentration nature of the spell. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/8/04
        <ul>
          <li>Refined the code that makes flipping a guild hall shield
            switch make you outlaw. Does not punish betrayal (an inside
            job). This allows guild owners to flip their own switch
            without penalty, also gives a way for more intrigue to
            happen. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/7/04
        <ul>
          <li>Made Battered, Tusked, and Daemon skeletons subclasses of
            Skeleton to reduce duplicated code. </li>
          <li>Lowered dementia and palsy attacks of battered skeleton to
            1 in 10 chance to go off (from 1 in 5). </li>
          <li>Lowered difficulty of battered skeleton to 4 (was 5). </li>
          <li>Changed Skeleton's Karma to -50 (from -70). </li>
          <li>Raised Daemon Skeleton's speed to SPEED_FAST (was
            SPEED_AVERAGE) </li>
          <li>Made flipping a guild switch an outlaw offense. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/3/04
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced value of Knight Shield to 800 (was 1000). An
            attempt to nerf Throne Room runs. </li>
          <li>Adjusted Tusked Skeleton's drop rates. Drops less Hammers,
            Inkies, drops more Money and Neru Arrows. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/27/04
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed problem with Holy Touch not doing extra damage.
            Changed it so that it does 200% to undead, or 150%-50%
            depending on non-undead opponent's karma. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/25/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed deflect to do it's basic checks in the spell file.
            Also changed it to reflect all AttackSpell class spells, not
            just single-target Faren spells. </li>
          <li>Changed Mark of Dishonor to not be castable on oneself. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/24/04
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed problem where glowed weapons weren't being
            considered properly in light calculations. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/18/04
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed the DistributeBetaPotions code. Changed it to be
            more suitable for what we want for current testing. Moved
            out SortUsersByPlayTime message out from original function.
            Moved the beta potions code to System instead of Util. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that allies can log back into the interior
            of a guild hall. Also changed it so that lowest ranking
            guild members of guild (or allied guilds) cannot. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that anyone that can enter a guild hall can
            also log off safely in the guild hall. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/17/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that an item with the quest item attribute
            cannot be shattered, swapped, etc. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/12/04
        <ul>
          <li>Added safety check to Shatterlock. Also added in
            additional resources to notify players of this fact. </li>
          <li>Made it so that token holders can be attacked in towns. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/5/04
        <ul>
          <li>Added back in the range bonus on attack spells and weapons
            for a moving user target to account for lag drift. Set it to
            a much lower value than perviously set to to account for the
            client-side fix of lag drift prediction. </li>
          <li>Changed Earthquake to do full damage to the caster if the
            spell is cast from a scroll. This is to prevent people from
            walking in and spamming scrolls to kill others. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/4/04
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bug where some spell items (notably the Earthquake
            scroll) weren't getting the proper targets. Spell items now
            get the targets from the spell itself. </li>
          <li>Added in parameter to Rumble in Room that allows you to
            control chance of disruption in addition to the duration of
            the rumble. Default is set to 0% disruption chance. Adjusted
            Lupogg King and Yeti to use this function instead of having
            their own functions. </li>
          <li>Increased Earthquake's chance to disrupt spells to 100%.
            This should avoid some of the problems with white characters
            chain-casting Earthquake on enemies. </li>
          <li>Changed Lupogg King's resistances to make him much less
            suceptible to arrows. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/3/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that messages and duration/avoidance
            calculations are handled in Eagle Eyes spell instead of
            indivdually in Dazzle and Blind. Added message for caster
            when person enchanted with Eagle Eyes resists a spell
            completely. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/12/04
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that players can lighten and darken rentable
            rooms through the decorator fairy. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/11/04
        <ul>
          <li>Moved portals to be a subclass of a portal superclass.
            Eliminated lots of redundant code. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/20/03
        <ul>
          <li>Increased defense from Umbrella to 500 (was 100). </li>
          <li>Changed it so that Izzio and Pacal no longer buy
            shillings. :) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/17/03
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminated ability to mend torches. Prevents cheezy way of
            working up mend by mending a torch that was used/unused
            quickly. </li>
          <li>Reduced bulk of torch to 10 (was 20). This brings it in
            line with the weight, increasing the number players can
            hold. </li>
          <li>Changed items to display a different message if the item
            has been repaired enough. The other message shows when the
            max hits of the item are below the lowest starting maximum
            number of hits. </li>
          <li>Changed Seance to be less sucky. Now have better chance to
            give real location at higher spellpower, up to 90% (was
            65%). Now only enchants the caster if the information is
            wrong, to prevent repeated casting attempts. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/15/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Feign Death to not drop items that shouldn't drop
            on death. Also changed chance to drop items to decrease as
            spellpower increases, 1-10% chance to drop each item (was
            previously 5%). Also increased defense added to 3 *
            spellpower (was 2 * spellpower). </li>
          <li>Reduced spellpower bonus/penalty for Ivy Circlets. Is not
            +/-15 for Shal'ille/Qor spells (was +/-25). This brings it
            in line with the orc shield. </li>
          <li>Lowered amount of healing Karma adds/subtracts in Minor
            Heal. Currently Karma/20 (was Karma/10). </li>
          <li>Increased amount of healing Karma adds/subtracts in
            Hospice. Currently Karma/10 (was Karma/20). </li>
          <li>Increased amount of healing spellpower adds in Major Heal.
            Currently spellpower/5 (was spellpower/10). Also increased
            maximum cap on amount healed to 50. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/13/03
        <ul>
          <li>Made it possible to "use" candelabras to turn them on and
            off. </li>
          <li>Changed faction insignia on herald shields to give a small
            random bonus to spellpower for all spells. Bonus ranges from
            3-7 points each cast. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/11/03
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that Feign Death also removes Illusionary Form
            to prevent strange side-effects of mixing and creating odd
            effects. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/28/03
        <ul>
          <li>Halved the casting time on Portal of Life to a base of 10
            seconds. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/14/03
        <ul>
          <li>Made Flash properly an Outlaw spell. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/8/03
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced Fungus Beast's level to 50 (was 60). This makes
            them a bit weaker, more in line with their power. </li>
          <li>Reduced Groundworm's difficulty to 5 (was 6). This makes
            them a bit less harsh. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/2/03
        <ul>
          <li>Increased the range for most non-bolt attack spells. Most
            increased by 1. Only major change was increasing Vampiric
            Drain's range by double. </li>
          <li>Increased the damage for most non-bolt attack spells. </li>
          <li>Increased the top end of Vampiric Drain's damage. </li>
          <li>Halved the reagent cost of Illusionary Wounds, but
            increased the mana cost to 10 (was 5). </li>
          <li>Increased duration on Resist Magic by about 50%. </li>
          <li><b>Patched the live servers.</b> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/30/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added in 5 mask objects. They use the circlet hotspot. </li>
          <li>Added in "special gift", which is a gift which gives 1 of
            the 5 mask types. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that the kill count decay counter only has a
            50% chance to decay each 6 hour cycle. This will make the
            decay slower for murderers. This is an attempt to reduce the
            strategy of some murderers to kill someone randomly then log
            off for a while. </li>
          <li>Changed it so all spells give the murmur message now. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/27/03
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed mixup where hammers gave a spellpower penalty
            whereas scimitars did not. </li>
          <li>Moved nerudite arrow sales from the island apothacary to
            the island merchant at the trading post. </li>
          <li>Reduced chance for nerudite arrows to drop from monsters.
          </li>
          <li>Reduced damage bonus from battle bows to 2 (was 3). Also
            reduced range to 17 (was 20). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/27/03
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced focus time, mana cost, and duration for Lightning
            Wall to 3 seconds, 20 mana, and 20 + 2 * spellpower,
            respectively (was 5 seconds, 25 mana, and 20 + 4/3 *
            spellpower). </li>
          <li>Fixed problem with trance spells with selected targets
            (like Earthquake) choosing the wrong targets (often in
            distant rooms). Updated monsters to handle this. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/14/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added projectile lighting information. </li>
          <li>Raised lower end of damage on fireball wands to 4 points
            (was 2). </li>
          <li>Added object lighting information. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/13/03
        <ul>
          <li>Made totems immune to the spell Sweep. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/9/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Armor of Gort to be less resistant to spell
            damage. Now only absorbs 1/2 the damage from weapon + spell
            damage types with max damage done of 20, and absorbs no
            damage from pure spell damage with max damage done of 25
            (was full absorb and max damage of 15, which is still the
            default for weapon damage.) </li>
          <li>Changed damage on arrows. Nerudite and Silver arrows now
            do a base 2-6 points of damage, with additional damage done
            due to special conditions. Silver arrowheads do extra damage
            to undead (as before) and nerudite arrowheads do additional
            damage, 3-8 points, if they "shatter" (10% of the time);
            they now shatter on any target (was previously only on
            insectoid targets). Overall, this slightly reduces the
            damage done by arrows. </li>
          <li>Made nerudite arrows come in stacks of 5 instead of 10.
            This will cause less to be dropped by slain monsters. </li>
          <li>Increased the thresholds for the damage messages. It now
            takes a bit more damage to get the same old messages as
            before. Thresholds are now 15 and 5 (was previously 10 and
            3). </li>
          <li>Changed silver and nerudite to weapon damage types (was
            previously spell damage types, which caused confustion with
            "all" type spell resistances). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/2/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that attacking will stop any rescue
            attempts. This includes attemps by spell or by item. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/1/03
        <ul>
          <li>Adjusted weapon values a bit for balance. Increased the
            upper damage on low damage weapons and decreased the
            lower-end damage for high damage weapons. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/30/03
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed it so that there's a Karma check for spell items
            (wands, etc) that aren't player made. </li>
          <li>Increased MSH's durability. Initial durability is 400-500
            (was 200-225). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/16/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added in values for reduction to base spellpower that bows
            cause. (Previously just used the default values set in
            weapon.kod.) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/21/03
        <ul>
          <li>Made it impossible to bond a prism. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/17/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed resist messages slightly. Will now give the
            anti-resist magic if resist is less than or equal to -20
            (used to be strictly less than). Also gives the
            (anti-)immunity message if resist is greater than (or equal
            to for the anti-immunity) if immunity is greater (less) than
            (-)60 (was previously (-)66). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/9/03
        <ul>
          <li>Lowered minimum death penalty from Portal of Life to 5%
            (was 20%). Changed because you have to have a full death
            penalty in order to eliminate outlaw status. </li>
          <li>Made sporeburst allowed in arenas. </li>
          <li>Fixed bug that made wall elements disappear in arenas and
            remain in guild halls. </li>
          <li>Fixed bug that allowed players with soldier shields to
            wield bows, lutes, and soldier shields simultaneously. </li>
          <li>Changed Necklace of Jala to resist disruptions 75% of the
            time (was previously 50% of the time). </li>
          <li>Changed it so a player can wear a necklace and hold a
            lute. </li>
          <li>Moved the instrument check from User to Player. </li>
          <li>Made it so that the instrument check in player will return
            the highest level instrument in the case of multiple
            instruments being wielded. This should allow a player to
            wear a necklace of Jala and hold a Lute, getting the
            benefitof the lute. </li>
          <li>Added in variable for who last edited an inscription item.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/18/03
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a problem with Truce and Spellbane working backwards
            in towns (IE, allowing unguilded people to cast, instead of
            allowing guilded people to do so). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/13/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that you have to take a full death penalty
            before losing your outlaw status. Outlaw status now only
            happens when you take death penalties, not when you die. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that immortal DMs can explicitly hold
            infinite items in their inventory according to GetMaxWeight
            and GetMaxBulk. </li>
          <li>Added Mystic swords as possible special magic items.
            Reduced the probability of maces and short swords to be
            selected to compensate. </li>
          <li>Lowered the value of inky-cap mushrooms to 250 (was 350).
            Vendors will now pay less for them. </li>
          <li>Increased the chance for Create Food to create an inky-cap
            mushroom. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that a player with over 2x their base max
            hps fighting a monster weaker than their base hps (IE, a
            player in morphed form fighting a creature weaker than their
            morphed form) will gain hit point advancement points at half
            the rate and will not get a gain check. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that someone getting a killing blow on a
            tough monster without taking damage still gets a chance to
            improve hit points. </li>
          <li><b>Patched the live servers.</b> </li>

      </li>
      <li>7/11/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that Spellbane cannot be used in town
            unguilded. </li>
          <li>Changed Spellbane to only cancel spells weaker than it's
            own spellpower. So, a Spellbane cast at 75 spell power will
            only block spells cast with less than 75 spell power. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that spell items work even if Spellbane and
            Silence are active. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/9/03
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that spells will recheck the final targets list
            afterwards the trance to eliminate "bad" targets,
            particularly those that go out of the room. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that a multi-target spell with an invalid
            NPC target will not cancel the casting of the spell
            entirely. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/7/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that frenzies will recognize "safe" rooms
            again. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that players will start with half life and
            mana in the underworld during a frenzy. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that the second wind will simply not advance
            if you're suspected of cheezing the skill, rather than not
            firing. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that Second Wind will actually give vigor
            upon death now. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that spell items sold to (or created by)
            Pacal and Izzio will not expire while they hold it. Potions
            bought from them will go bad after the normal time. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/5/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that knowing spells of a certain level will
            always allow you to buy spells of a previous level. </li>
          <li>Added another state to RecreateAll in the system object.
            This is intended to prevent the server from killing the
            RecreateAll, thinking it's an infinite loop with too many
            function calls. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/3/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that you can use lutes with soldier shields
            as well. </li>
          <li>Renamed the resource for light spell sound. </li>
          <li>Made spell items created by NPCs for in their sale list
            not expire. This makes potions not appear bad if you look at
            them in the sales list. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/2/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that faction soldiers are treated like
            guilded players or murderers in towns. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that we have a central function to check for
            "guild only" restrictions in rooms. The message name is
            AllowGuildAttack, and returns TRUE if the room does not
            restrict guild attacks or if an attack (or any other
            interaction) is allowed between two parties in a
            guild-restricted attack room. Currently, guilded people,
            murderers, and people with soldier shields are fair game in
            towns. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that unguilded murderers and people with
            soldier shields can still cast Truce in town along with
            guilded players. </li>
          <li>Fixed it so that soldiers never have to do loyalty quests.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/28/03
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminated the fire resistance from Orc Shields. </li>
          <li>Eliminated Berzerker Ring's bonus to damage if weapon is a
            ranged weapon. </li>
          <li>Fixed bug that was preventing Brawling from adding to
            punch damage appropriately. </li>
          <li>Changed ranged weapons to use Aim for the damage bonus
            instead of Might. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that two Jewels of Froz can be used once
            again. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that Mana Convergence doesn't affect
            Anti-Magic Aura and vice versa. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that the calculations for determining the
            affect of Mana Convergence and Anti-Magic Aura heppen in
            individual spell files, not in spell.kod. </li>
          <li>Eliminated the incorrect assumption that all rooms with
            the SafeDeath flag are automatically arenas. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/24/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed scrolls and wands to not expire by default. </li>
          <li>Changed Morph to increase the base duration by about 20%.
            Also changed final randomization to 80-120% of the final
            time, isntead of being random half to full of the final
            time. This increases the duration overall. </li>
          <li>Set Obfal's Sepulchre (RID_ORC_CAVE5) to NOT be
            TERRAIN_LAKE (?!?). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/23/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that admins can edit player descriptions and
            URLs. </li>
          <li>Added in a very simple profanity filter check for posts
            and player descriptions. We keep a set of "naughty words" on
            the server side, and do a simple replacement. </li>
          <li>Added message to a player target of Glow for when their
            weapon is enchanted. </li>
          <li><b>Patched the live servers.</b> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/21/03
        <ul>
          <li>Lowered the dispose timer in the Orc Pit Boss lair to 2
            minutes. This will clear away items faster than before. </li>
          <li>Added polished seraphym as a new reagent for Anti-Magic
            Aura. Also increased the mana cost to 15 (was 20) and
            decreased initial chance to improve to 10 (was 15). </li>
          <li>Increased the base cost of polished seraphym to 100 (was
            90). Should make them sell for a bit more to NPCs, as well
            as be a bit more expensive to buy from NPCs. </li>
          <li>Changed Izzio to be MERCHANT_DISCOUNT (was the default
            MERCHANT_NORMAL previously). This should make him pay a bit
            more to buy stuff, and cost a bit less to sell stuff. Also
            moved Plate armor to the "really good" list, moved Scimitar
            to the "pretty good" list, and replaced enfeeble wand with
            BattleBow on the "really good" list of "junk" to sell. </li>
          <li>Changed the default of pbActor in Admins to TRUE. </li>
          <li>Added Dusk Rats as monster in the koc'catan sewers. More
            spawn more frequently in the second sewer (that's only
            accessible from Tepal's area). </li>
          <li>Added book to Marion Adventurer's Hall explaining how the
            territory game works. </li>
          <li>Made it so that if either player cannot hold the objects
            being swapped, the swap will fail. </li>
          <li>Added a bunch of new songs to the Duke's ballroom. </li>
          <li>Changed some Jala spell songs to include the new songs. </li>
          <li><b>Patched the live servers.</b> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/20/03
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a bug that was making potions bought from the store
            not expire. Bought potions now go bad in 24 hours. </li>
          <li>Changed new rentable rooms to start off with 4 heartstone
            "credits" of each type. Enough to do some decorating, but
            not enough to get a chest. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/19/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added in some "Historical" old rooms. They're separate
            rooms that are maps of towns before they were remodeled. The
            RIDS are: RID_OLD_JASPER, RID_OLD_MARION, RID_OLD_BAR_NORTH,
            RID_OLD_BAR_SOUTH. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/18/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that you cant take partial stacks of items
            out of guildhall chests if you're not allowed to take the
            objects according to the guild hall owner. </li>
          <li>Added new food "Turkey Leg". Half as heavy, filling, and
            nutritious as cheese, but at 60% of the price. A pretty good
            food, but a bit expensive. </li>
          <li>Added new turkey leg food to be sold by Pritchett, the
            innkeeper in Barloque. It fits, because he is holding a tray
            with some sort of roast bird on it. </li>
          <li>Added new turkey leg food as a possible result of the
            Create Food spell. Slightly adjusted other probabilities to
            compensate for the addition. </li>
          <li>Changed Rescue so that if you're in the Spring of
            Vitality, you'll teleport to Ko'catan Inn; casting Rescue in
            the orc caves will still take you to the Spring of Vitality.
          </li>
          <li>Changed Rescue so that if you're guilded with a guild
            hall, you'll teleport to your guild hall if it's in the same
            region you are now. If not, you'll go to the default
            location for the region. If you cast rescue in your guild
            hall, you'll go to the default location in the region. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/16/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added nerudite bow as a type of bow. Not terribly good,
            but worth a good chunk of money. To be given out as a booby
            prize for one of Moxal's quests. </li>
          <li>Added new "magic" bow. You can set range on it, and also
            easily set color. </li>
          <li>Added piDamageBonus and piHitBonus properties to weapons.
            These can be used by DMs to increase (or decrease) the
            damage and to-hit bonuses of weapons. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/14/03
        <ul>
          <li>Made guildhall weapons work anywhere as long as wielder's
            guild has the hall. Only gives half bonuses if you're not
            actually inside the guild hall and using it, however. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/12/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added a hidden bonus: If a player casts Elusion with a
            high enough spellpower, they can say the name of their
            guild's guildhall and teleport to the foyer. Has no effect
            on people not in guilds or in guilds without guildhalls. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/11/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added a feature so that if someone in the top three ranks
            of a guild says the name of another guild member in front of
            Frular, he will say if the guildmember is active or not (IE,
            has logged on in the last 60 days). Uses the IsUserInactive,
            the same as faction power does. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/10/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added the ability to give out objects during a frenzy to
            the System object. The message is ChaosNightLoot. More
            details in the event document. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that Soldier Shields will try to delete
            themselves if held by a user that isn't the right faction.
            Exceptions made for DMs and above. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/8/03
        <ul>
          <li>Made Bar (Barking Monster) and hall (Hall of Heroes) in
            Ko'catan safe to logoff at. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/7/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added a superclass Bow, from which new bow types can be
            derived. </li>
          <li>Moved Longbow class to subclass of Bow. Changed name to
            "longbow", changed color, kept the original stats of the bow
            (no damage increase, 100 range). Added a +100 to-hit
            modifier. All existing bows in the game will become this
            type. </li>
          <li>Added BattleBow class weapon "battle bow". Gives +3 damage
            per arrow but only has a 20 range. No to-hit bonus. A bit
            more expensive than the longbow (3000 vs. 2500). </li>
          <li>Added PracticeBow class weapon "practice bow". Gives a -3
            penalty to damage, only has a range of 30, but has a +200 to
            hit and is about twice as durable as a normal bow. Also
            cheaper than the other bows. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/5/03
        <ul>
          <li>Doubled the number of non-chest items that heartstones
            allow you to place in a room to 10 (was 5 previously). Still
            takes one of each heartstone to place a chest. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/4/03
        <ul>
          <li>Renamed the Wooden Box object to "old wooden box" (class
            Box). This will now only be available in rentable rooms if
            they were placed before the change to rentable rooms. </li>
          <li>Created new storage box type "personal chest" (class
            SmallBox), which holds 75% of the bulk wooden boxes hold.
            Also has a slightly smaller graphic (same image, higher
            shrink factor). To be used in rentable rooms. </li>
          <li>Created new storage box type "wooden box" (class
            WoodenBox). This holds twice what the "old wooden box" will
            hold. </li>
          <li>Increased the storage capacty of the metal chest storage
            box to triple previous. </li>
          <li>Made sure checks to prevent items from being put into
            chests and boxes were changed to check for the superclass
            StorageBox instead. </li>
          <li>Changed Rentable Rooms to use the new "personal chest"
            object instead of the wooden boxes. This will not affect
            boxes already placed. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/1/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added rebel faction special weapon attribute. Technically,
            it already existed, but it would show up as Princess in
            name. I added the resources needed to show the proper
            description. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that faction weapons will work against
            monsters. Gives half bonuses against unfactioned players and
            monsters, gives full bonuses against enemy factions, gives
            no bonus against the same faction. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that at max, Spore burst only uses 24
            passive elements instead of 48 as previously. New formation
            gives the illusion of a mass of clouds by intelligent
            placement. Also looks a bit more circular. </li>
          <li>Changed the max number of wall spells in a room to 2
            instead of 3. This was done by setting the max number of
            summoned items allowed in a room in the System object. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that Spore Burst would never be cast if
            there's already a wall spell in the room. Previously, you
            could cast an infinite number of Spore Bursts. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/28/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added new message to Holder, CanCarryWeightAndBulk.
            Returns TRUE if the holder can hold that much weight and
            bulk. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that if one person in an offer can't carry
            all the items offered, the offer will fail and not be
            completed. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/23/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that if a player hasn't moved yet (IE,
            alerted monsters), it only ignores timer-regenerated health
            increases. Previously, the player ignored all health
            increases, making improving healing-related spells very easy
            to do on an unmoving mule. </li>
          <li>Fixed it so that AllowPlayerAttack checks for room
            validity where the victim is. This should allow wall spells
            to follow the proper rules based on location. EG, a wall
            spell in town will only affect guilded/murderers/soldiers,
            etc, regardless of caster location. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that it uses the generic "X was killed by Y"
            message during frenzies instead of turning everyone into a
            murderer. This gives an accurage portrayal of who's killing
            whom without altering the murderer status of people. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/9/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Avars, Avar Chieftains, and Avar Shamans to send
            GetTrueName to the killer to mark the corpse. This prevents
            the problem of morphed characters being unable to pick up
            loot from these monsters that they kill. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that the PK Pointer attribute (which does
            not allow angeled characters to pick up or accept loot from
            PK deaths) to penalty items dropped by logoff ghosts. This
            should disallow mules from just grabbing items from the
            ground from logoff penalties. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/8/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed "Ghostly Items" to use color translations. Got rid
            of the transparency effect (which didn't look too
            transparent, really), which was interfering with the color
            translations. Renamed it to "illusionary item" (but didn't
            change class name). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/7/03
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced weight and bulk of edible mushrooms to 2 and 3
            (was 5 and 10!!!). This reflects their relative uselessness
            as items other than reagents. </li>
          <li>Reduced the value of edible mushrooms to 20 (was 25). Make
            them a bit less attractive to merchants given the weight
            reduction. </li>
          <li>Increased purple mushroom's value to 80 (was 60). This
            increases the price paid for them by NPCs and also increases
            the price NPCs charge. </li>
          <li>Increased value of entroot berries to 60 (was 40). This
            increases the price paid for them by NPCs. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/6/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added in faction vigor reduction. Bonus reduces all
            exertion added (and thus vigor consumed) by a base of 30%.
            Added this power to the Duke faction. </li>
          <li>Moved faction bonus to mana regeneration to Princess
            faction. </li>
          <li>Added in function IsUserInactive in User. Returns True if
            the player hasn't logged in in about 2 months (60 days). Can
            be used to check to see if a player hasn't logged on in a
            while. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/5/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed around the sound system. Looping "ambient" sound
            is determined by room type, but only one type will be
            chosen. Periodic sounds are determined by room type as well,
            but multiple types of sounds can be added to a single room
            (IE, the King's Way (RID_G6) will have mountain, forest, and
            ocean type periodic sounds). The more periodic sounds the
            room can play, the more frequently sounds will be played.
            This should allow for more "natural" sounds in different
            areas. </li>
          <li>Changed the light modification in the Barloque sewers. The
            different of the sewer now use full, one half, and one
            quarter the light value (was 1/2, 1/3, 1/5). This should
            make the first layer a bit more friendly for newbies trying
            to use "light" to see. </li>
          <li>Changed the Firepit object to take a sound radius
            parameter as the constructor. This determines how far the
            fire sound can be heard. A radius of 0 means no sound. </li>
          <li>Changed Fountain and FountainJet to work like Firepits do
            for sound, only with the water sound. Added an additional
            "intensity" parameter which determines how loud to play the
            sound. Went through and removed all artifical fountain
            sounds in rooms. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/4/03
        <ul>
          <li>Increased the "bonus" for casting Shal'ille spells in
            Necropolis areas to 0 (was -15). </li>
          <li>Defined the newbie/guest mausoleum, Tos crypt, and Marion
            Crypt as "Necropolis" areas. </li>
          <li>Set sewers to use the looping sounds defined in room.kod
            instead of what they were individually set to. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/2/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that a guild can only declare enemies once
            it is mature. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that disbanding a guild will still reward an
            enemy guild in a mutually declared war. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/1/03
        <ul>
          <li>Lowered the factor for spells improving over softcap to
            1/4th normal improve chance (was 1/5th). </li>
          <li>Changed it so that if a player drops an item, it will
            reset the dispose timer to be at least 1 minute in duration.
            This should eliminate the problem of dropped items
            disappearing "immediately". </li>
          <li>Changed Forces of Light spell to add a bonus to Shal'ille
            spells cast. It adds 1/10th the spellpower of Forces of
            Light to the spell power of the new spell cast. </li>
          <li>Moved Forces of Light to under the subclass of
            RoomEnchantment. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/30/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added AddLoopingSound to room.kod. Allows something to add
            a looping sound to the room, such as a fire-based object
            adding a looping fire sound. Also added
            RemoveObjectLoopingSound to remove the looping sounds added
            by an object (recorded as an optional last element in the
            looping sound list). </li>
          <li>Changed the firepit to add a crackling noise to the room
            when added. This can be disabled with a parameter sent to
            Constructor. </li>
          <li>Moved the light source passive objects that were under
            PassiveObject to under Flickerer. While not all of them
            benefit from the infrastructure, it is conceptually nicer
            and easier to find the light source objects. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/29/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added Jala statue to the Ko'catan Hall of Heroes. Added
            appropriate things to Lore to make it work right. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/28/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that wielded torches give a 10 spellpoint
            bonus to Faren spells (since Faren spells depend on fire
            bonuses). </li>
          <li>Changed Rescue to add in random(0,3000) millisecond delay
            to the final delay of Rescue 50% of the time to add some
            unpredictability. This additional time is not decreased by
            spellpower. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/27/03
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bug in Riija temple that made people drop
            undroppable items when they "died". </li>
          <li>Changed resist poison to be more effective and last
            longer. Now has a good chance to completely resist poison at
            higher levels, and will much longer (5-15 minute base time
            compared to 2-4 minute base time previously). This should
            make fighting poisonous enemies much more tolerable. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/24/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that the ghost spawns roughly once every two
            hours in the throne room. This gives players the ability to
            hunt the ghost, it also gives players a reason to let the
            room reset on a regular basis to clear excess items on the
            ground. Ghost will still appear normally if the room has
            been properly cleared. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/23/03
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminated some of the sounds from the movable sector
            objects in the Ancient Place (RID_G9). This means the noise
            that plays when the puzzle is solved won't be quite so
            obnoxious. </li>
          <li>Changed Ancient Place (RID_G9) to randomize the levers 5%
            of the time when they are solved. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/17/03
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed it so that if you are wearing a robe you can use
            another robe to wear it. Formerly, if you tried to use
            another robe it would simply unwear the first robe. </li>
          <li>Changed LightRobe to be a subclass of Robe instead of
            Armor. </li>
          <li>Changed the newbie areas (Raza) to give a 50% increased
            bonus to improve spells and skills. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/15/03
        <ul>
          <li>Put in the first pass of the new cheating detection. What
            it does is check to see if a player is sending too many
            packets per move. This will help spot speedhackers. Full
            details to be put in the cheating documentation. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/11/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed totems and relics to not show up when you hit
            return. Makes them easier to hide. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/10/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added code so that non-harmful outlaw spells will still
            turn you outlaw, even if it doesn't check against a list of
            targets. This is needed to make sure spells like Shatterlock
            still turn you into an outlaw. </li>
          <li>Changed Resist Magic to tighten up the resist range. Now
            resists 10-40% of damage depending on spellpower (was
            1-50%). Also lowered total base duration by 1 minute to 40 +
            spellpower * 2 seconds (was 100 + spellpower*2 seconds). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/9/03
        <ul>
          <li>Made bows fully color translatable. We can now use
            different color translations for different types of bows. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/9/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added the projectile flag PROJ_FLAG_LIGHT_SOURCE. This is
            used in the new 3D client to add dynamic lighting effects
            for projectiles that require it. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/7/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed bramble walls to act more like normal wall
            elements with regards to safeties. That is, they now check
            safeties before trying to affect a player. </li>
          <li>Added messages for token deaths and deaths caused by
            soldiers. These new deaths will not count as murders and
            will not alter the readings from seance, etc. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/5/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that the base light level in the Vale areas
            will raise/lower as the areas become more good/evil. </li>
          <li>Added the FLICKERING_YES flag to the ghost and spectral
            mummies. This should make them look lit in dark areas, and
            give them sources of light in the new client. </li>
          <li>Made blinded players unable to go through doors (or
            anything else that uses SomethingTryGo). </li>
          <li>Changed it so that spells that are not accessible or
            enabled aren't offered to newbie characters at character
            creation. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/4/03
        <ul>
          <li>Put in message throttling. The server will refuse to
            accept certain classes of messages from the client after a
            certain number of messages have been sent in one second.
            Currently, this number is set at 5. Only certain messages
            will be ignored; the type that will not put the client out
            of sync with the server. This is intended to stop some of
            the spamming techniques some players have developed. </li>
          <li>If a player does not have a clear line of sight to a
            target when attacking, their offense is reduced to one third
            (making them miss three times as often). This should put a
            dent in cheats that ignore walls on the client. It also has
            the nice side effect of making "safe spots" less attractive.
          </li>
          <li>If a player does not have a clear line of sight to a
            target when casting a spell, then the spell has 1/3 the
            normal chance to cast successfully. This should put a dent
            in cheats that ignore walls on the client. It also has the
            nice side effect of making "safe spots" less attractive. </li>
          <li>Changed wands to fail if there's no line of sight between
            the player using the wand and the target of the wand. </li>
          <li>Added FLICKERING_YES flag to most light-source type items.
            This will be used by the new client to assign light sources
            in the short term. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/3/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Kara'hol's Curse to give a message if caster is
            already enchanted. </li>
          <li>Fixed a bug in Personal Enchantment that caused it to not
            print the proper message if the caster was already enchanted
            if not overriden. </li>
          <li>Added in server-side detection for attacks and spell
            targets that are way outside the normal range of vision.
            This is to combat a cheat that allows you to hit or cast
            spells at anyone in the room without the normal visibility
            checks. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/2/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Shatterlock to have a more reasonable time
            requirement, to fit under the new spell system. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/1/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that immortal admins do not lose vigor and
            will not have their mana reset by ComputeMaxMana. </li>
          <li>Changed faction troops to optionally use the faction
            shields instead of normal guild shields. Necromancers still
            use the normal colored guild shield. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/31/03
        <ul>
          <li>All spells cast in a room are now properly reported to any
            DMs in the room. Message includes caster's real name,
            spell's name, and name of the target, if appropriate.
            Removed old code that gave a message when the DM was a
            target of the spell from spell.kod. </li>
          <li>Added in SquelchPlayer message in player.kod. This toggles
            the player's ability to broadcast. If set, this prevents the
            player from broadcasting. </li>
          <li>Added DM spell "Squelch" to call the SquelchPlayer message
            described above. </li>
          <li>Changed Pacal to only buy a limited number of number
            items. This will prevent hundreds of thousands of rainbow
            ferns from showing up on his inventory. </li>
          <li>Changed Pacal so that he will lose 1/3 of stacked number
            items and has a 1 in 3 chance to delete non-number items on
            a regular basis of 12-24 hours. This was accomplished by
            changing the timer that creates junk for him to hold. </li>
          <li>Reduced resistance of robes of the disciple of
            ATCK_SPELL_FIRE damage to -20% (was -10%). </li>
          <li>Added resistance of robes of the disciple to all weapon
            damage of -10%. This was recorded in the docs, but not put
            into the robes properly. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/30/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that player will go to the rooms Blink
            coordinates if they take a logoff penalty, including a free
            penalty or no penalty for being a newbie. This is to prevent
            people from getting continuous crashes. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/29/03
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed various sounds, including the fountain in South
            Barloque, the waterfall in the God's room, doors and water
            splashing in Guildhall 5 (Konima's Abandoned Dwelling), etc.
          </li>
          <li>Changed Vertigo so that it will not enchant monsters that
            are already affected by palsy </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/28/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Truce so that it will only be castable in towns by
            an unguilded character if there is a monster in the room.
            Spell is still castable by a DM, however. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that a player leaving the underworld via a
            portal of life or via the node portal is paralyzed
            temporarily while the transition is made. This should fix
            some of the exploits people have done where they try to
            continue moving while moving through these portals, allowing
            them to warp to other places in the target room. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that angle changes (turns) while paralyzed
            are ignored. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that sending an action (pointing, smiling,
            frowning, etc) hooks into the attack rate system. In other
            words, if you do an action you have to wait 1 second before
            you can make an attack or take another action. This is to
            prevent the spammers who send multiple </li>
          <li>Added server-side detection to check if a player is
            running below the normal vigor threshold. This is the result
            of a cheat on the client side. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/27/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that the spell superclass allows you to
            target yourself with a harmful spell if the spell calls for
            only a single target. Most single-target spells already
            prevent people from targetting themselves if appropriate.
            This allows players to use Purge on themselves with no
            penalty. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/25/03
        <ul>
          <li>MASSIVE change to spell system. Spells can now build a
            specific list of targets affected at casting time. This list
            is pared down for offensive spells, taking status and safety
            into consideration, and stored in plFinalTargets for use
            during spell casting phase. This simplifies the casting,
            since it allows that all targets in this list are valid, and
            reduces duplicated checking. </li>
          <li>Spells that affect a group of players, such as Mana Bomb
            and Earthquake, will now fail to cast if there are not any
            valid targets in the area. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/24/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Flash to have a chance to stun monsters in the
            room for 1 second. Due to new monster effect, spell is now
            allowed on Sacred Haven. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/23/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Staff of Jolting to have a 3 second pause after
            use. User can take no other offensive action for 3 seconds
            after use. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/21/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that immortal admins can always attack a
            target of their choice. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/19/03
        <ul>
          <li>Removed the "newbie safe" flag from Xeochicatls. They'll
            now attack angeled characters in the area. This was done to
            prevent angeled loot mules from running free. </li>
          <li>Changed wall spell elements to affect players as
            determined by the normal safety rules for outlaws and
            murderers. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/14/03
        <ul>
          <li>Increased the damage cap on bonus damage caused by Might.
            This helps match the current reality of players having up to
            70 might instead of the previous max of 50. </li>
          <li>Changed newbie portal so that new players (IE, ones that
            have PFLAG_TUTORIAL unset) must enter the Raza portal twice
            before being sent to the mainland. This should prevent
            "accidentally" leaving Raza early. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/13/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that DMs and above can have "unavailable"
            spells in Sacred Haven. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that soldier shields will be slung on the
            back if the player tries to wield a bow. Bow image from the
            third-person perspective also swaps to show the colored
            bands. </li>
          <li>Added dm command "dm item junk" to create a junk item. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/11/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added logging of when Potions of Forgetfulness are used. </li>
          <li>Added logging for which hall is broken into when players
            enter a guild hall after door is closed. </li>
          <li>Added logging in the debug stream for when a hall's
            defenses are flipped. Previously it just gmailed the server
            guardian. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/20/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Mark of Dishonor to restrict players going over
            max hps. This is intended to add a bit more depth to
            Shal'ille's strategy, and allow people to knock down people
            significantly over maximum hps (such as people recently
            changed back from a Morphed form). Player now checks for
            this in NewHealth, which should be called after most health
            changes (IE, ones that could take the player over max
            health.) </li>
          <li>Changed Mark of Dishonor's duration to be dependent on
            spell power. Now lasts 2-10 minutes based on spell power
            (was a flat 10 minutes before). </li>
          <li>Changed Morph to do a NewHealth after changing form. This
            allows Mark of Dishonor to do it's new job. </li>
          <li>Changed Breath of Life to allow up to 130 max hps total
            (was 60). Also changed it to check for Mark of Dishonor
            before granting additional life. </li>
          <li>Changed amount of Breath of Life's effect. Caster now
            sacrifices the target's Karma (bound 10 to 80)% of their hps
            (won't go below 10 hps). Target gains 75 + spell power/2% of
            the sacrifice, not to exceed 150% of max life or 130 hps
            total. </li>
          <li>Changed Minor Heal to cap between 1 and 10 points healed
            (was 0-15). Now adds 2-5 points to amount healed if target
            is a newbie. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/13/03
        <ul>
          <li>Modified Morph's duration dependant upon the difference
            between the player's HPs and the Morphed form's level.
            Players shifting into forms with a lower level increase the
            duration while players shifting into forms with a higher
            level will see lessened duration. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that players that change forms with morph
            will use the target's level as base hps, instead of the
            targets actual hps. Player now shifts to +/-10% of
            creature's hps. </li>
          <li>Placed a 600 ms casting time on Hospice. </li>
          <li>Placed a 600 ms casting time on Minor Heal </li>
          <li>Increased maximum effect of Major Heal to 40 hps healed
            (was 35). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/4/03
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it to give newbies (with the Tutorial flag) half
            their mana upon death. Makes it easier for them to broadcast
            with. </li>
          <li>Added a debug log to record the piDeathCost of people who
            take death penalties. Can be useful. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/19/03
        <ul>
          <li>Added .5 second casting time to Create Weapon and Create
            Food. This should prevent people from macroing the spells by
            holding down a hotkey. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that key copies given to innkeepers that
            rent rooms will be destroyed. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/16/03
        <ul>
          <li>Players in Raza will not get any penalty for death, beyond
            having to rest up to regain vitals. </li>
          <li>Player with the Tutorial flag set (new players that
            haven't rerolled or gotten over 30) now get a gmail from
            their guardian angel about death upon dying. These players
            won't lose hps and will lose half the normal points. </li>
          <li>Eliminated Stamina-based reduction for logoff penalties.
            This means that logoff penalties are harsher now (about 2x
            as harsh for someone with 50 Stamina). </li>
          <li>Eliminated the percent of max hps damage cap for people
            with 50+ hps over their max. This means that anyone who
            morphs to get a high hp creature then gets dispelled will
            take damage in accordance to their new hps, not their old
            max. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/8/03
        <ul>
          <li>Lowered the initial improve chance for Morph to 35 (was
            65). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/30/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Discordance to auto-remove even a single
            enchantment in the room if the power is high enough. </li>
          <li>Changed the Assassin's game to not kick people off who are
            currently online. </li>
          <li>Fixed problem with not being able to cast offensive spells
            on faction enemies in town. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/19/02
        <ul>
          <li><b>Patched the live servers.</b> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/18/02
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminated penalties for attacking and killing a token
            holder. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that players cannot rescue out of OOG
            (either by chalice or spell). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/16/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed rentable rooms to no longer try to dispose loose
            items if a player is in the room. </li>
          <li>Removed Sword of the Hunt restrictions for the Hunt spell.
          </li>
          <li>Changed it so that reflections change immediately when the
            owner changes. </li>
          <li>Reduced the values of Nerudite swords and Battle Bows.
            This is an attempt to make elusion mules a bit less
            profitable. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/15/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made Roq a more expensive merchant. He is now
            MERCHANT_EXPENSIVE, where before he was MERCHANT_NORMAL (the
            default). This means he will pay less for items you offer
            him. This balanced with the fact that he buys everything. </li>
          <li>Added in text to the disciple quests to "tell" the
            priestess when done. This should help some of the confusion
            these quests create. </li>
          <li>Changed one target of the Shal'ille disciple quest to Duke
            Akardius (was Faren priestess). There could have been a
            conflict with the word "blessing" in the quest cargo and the
            spell "bless" sold by the priestess. Akardius needs more
            pardoning than the priestess did, anyway. ;) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/14/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added living statue monsters. About as difficult as
            skeletons, unless it's declared as a "soldier" type, then
            it's about as hard as an Avar. Statue does not give text
            description of damage, instead damage is shown by missing
            parts of the statue. Statue is inert and does not look like
            a monster until its target gets close enough to make it
            spring to life. </li>
          <li>Took out all references to the animation configuration
            from the client executable. This should eliminate the last
            bit of the animation bug people abuse. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/13/02
        <ul>
          <li>Bound maximum possible hit points to 150. This is for
            anyone with 50 or greater stamina. This needed to be done
            since Stamina could go over 50 with various bonuses and
            items. </li>
          <li>Increased the time before you can rejoin a guild after
            leaving to 4 hours (was 3 hours). Increased the time before
            you can rejoin the same guild to 72 hours. </li>
          <li>Added subject lines to the Assassin's Game gmails from
            Roq. </li>
          <li>Increased mule timer to 15 minutes (IE, after attacking
            another player, you cannot be affected by "mules" for 15
            minutes afterwards). Was 10 minutes. This is so the mule
            timer is longer than the logoff ghost timer. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/12/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added hit point restrictions to quests. Quests can now
            require a minimum hp level to begin. </li>
          <li>Added not having an item as a restriction for a quest.
            This works well for quests that given an item out, like the
            Jala Necklace or soldier shield quests. Checks to make sure
            the player does NOT have the item in question before giving
            out the quest. </li>
          <li>Added quest to get Jala necklace. Starts at Parrin and
            involves lots of travel and the sacrifice of a Lute. </li>
          <li>Added quests to get the soldier shields from the lieges.
            Requires 70 hps to start, then requires killing 2 opposing
            faction soldiers. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/11/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added Event Signs to the game. These are DM placable signs
            to give a visual reminder of events. Using the admin window,
            you can customize time/date information on the sign. </li>
          <li>Active faction soldiers (with rank 5 or greater) will not
            have to do loyalty quests for their liege. </li>
          <li>Only faction soldiers can claim flagpoles or pick up flags
            now. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/10/02
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced Light's cost to 5 mana (was 10). </li>
          <li>Reduced Illusionary Wounds' cost to 5 mana (was 15).
            Lowered vigor cost to 3 (was 15). </li>
          <li>Reduced the cost of Shocking Fury, Blast of Fire, and
            Explosive Frost to 8 mana (was 10). </li>
          <li>Reduced Vampiric Drain's cost to 10 mana (was 12). Also
            increased base damage range to 12-15 (was 9-12). </li>
          <li>Increased Fireball's mana cost to 7 (was 5). </li>
          <li>Slightly incresaed spellpower requirement for Elusion's
            teleport options. Previously, you could teleport to all 6
            locations with a 90 spellpower. Now requires at least a 96
            spellpower. </li>
          <li>Added in the message "Jumpstart" in the Quest engine. A
            quick and dirty way to jumpstart everything if some quests
            are not working. </li>
          <li>Replaced individual strings for faction liege names in
            Territory game with calls to Parliament to get centralized
            strings. </li>
          <li>Added Soldier Shields to the game. SoldierShield is the
            superclass, under which are shields for specific factions
            (PrincessShield, DukeShield, RebelShield). These shields
            must be worn and cannot be gotten rid of in any of the usual
            ways. They provide some shield defense (while not requiring
            the block skill). Each shield gives a bonus to 2 specific
            stats, determined by faction. Each shield also gives a
            faction-specific bonus to the character. Users with the
            shields can attack other faction members with these shields
            without penalty (murderer, revenant, etc). Users gain rank
            by killing faction enemies, lose rank by dying to faction
            enemies or taking log penalties. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/8/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed the client so that it queries the server for
            updates after a player changes guild standing (declares or
            undeclares and ally or enemy). This allows us to accept or
            reject a change in guild standing and have that reflected on
            the client. </li>
          <li>Added in financial penalty for withdrawl from a mutual
            guild war. A guild must have at least 50k shillings prepaid
            rent in order to declare an enemy. If two guilds mutually
            declare each other as an enemy, then they are at war. If one
            guild undeclares the other as enemy, they lose 50k from
            rent. The winner gest 60% of the positive amount lost by the
            losing guild. So, if a guild had 30k prepaid rent and
            undeclared from a mutual war, the guild would be at 20k owed
            and the winner would get 18k added to their rent. </li>
          <li>Added a 2 hour (1 Meridian day) delay when undeclaring a
            guild as an enemy that has mutually declared your guild as
            an enemy. The financial penalties mentioned above happen
            when the enemy is first undeclared. During this delay, the
            war continues as before. After this delay, the war ends and
            the guild is removed as an enemy. Only one guild may be
            undeclared an enemy at any one time. </li>
          <li>Updated the maturity guild letter to include the rules
            about war. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/7/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed FreeHands to only free items from hands if there
            are no restrictions. (IE, the items are not cursed). This
            was called by Jig to remove all objects from hands,
            including cursed weapons. </li>
          <li>Added Soldiers' Shields for new Faction Soldiers scenario.
          </li>
          <li>Changed it so that the first binding on mana regeneration
            time happens after the faction adjustment, not before. This
            means that the Duke regeneration "bonus" is no longer quite
            as potent. </li>
          <li>Reduced the lower mana regeneration time to 1000 ms (was
            1500 ms). This means that mana will be limited to 1 mana
            point per second. The Jala spell of "Rejuvenate" which
            increases mana regeneration can lower this down to 500 ms
            per point regenerated (was 750). </li>
          <li>Increased Distill's spellpower penalty for high level
            spells to 15 * spell level (was 5 * spell level). However,
            also added the caster's hit points as a determiner to offset
            this. This penalty is reduced by the caster's (hps - 20), so
            that the penalty can be 0 but never "positive". For example,
            a caster is making a 4th level spell into a potion. The
            penalty for this is 60 points. A 20 hp character gets no
            bonus, a 50 hp character reduces the penalty to 30 (60 - (50
            - 20)), and a 100 hp character has no penalty. This was
            implemented to discourage mules from creating high level
            potions. </li>
          <li>Added in a new debug message for when characters get
            suicided. </li>
          <li>Added in newbie Honor string. This string will show up in
            the bio of true newbies to the land. This string goes away
            if you get the Tutorial flag set; this happens if you become
            2 Meridian years old or if you become player-killable. This
            is a slight change from before, where you got the Tutorial
            flag set when you hit 25 hit points. This was added as a way
            for people to recognize true newbies vs. those that reroll
            characters. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/4/02
        <ul>
          <li>Armaggedon and Smite now work on groundworms. </li>
          <li>Increased chance for battered skeletons and decreased
            chance for Zombies in the Throne room. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/1/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made Jasper smith (Quintor) willing to buy weapons and
            wearables. </li>
          <li>Made Jasper merchant (Zhieu B'hob) willing to buy
            reagents. Now sells Elderberries, Mushrooms, and Blue
            Mushrooms in addition to what was sold before. Also sells
            shirts of a similar color to the pants he sold previously. </li>
          <li>Made the Tos apothecary (Frisconar) a Discount merchant
            (was Bargain). This will make him a bit less favorable of a
            merchant. </li>
          <li>Made the Barloque apothecary (Joguer) a Discount merchant
            (was Normal). This will make him a bit more favorable of a
            merchant. Also added Elderberries as a purchasable reagent
            from him. </li>
          <li>Made the Marion healer (Lady Aftyn) a Normal merchant (was
            Ripoff). This will make her a bit more favorable of a
            merchant. </li>
          <li>The Marion smith (Cohorr) willing to buy shields as well
            as weapons. This should help newbies hunting in the Marion
            Crypt. </li>
          <li>Changed all god's gifts to give +5 to main stat and +2 to
            secondary (was +3/+1). </li>
          <li>Made Martyr's Battleground a semi-permanent enchantment in
            the Marion Crypt. The enchantment has no expiration,
            although it can be removed with Discordance. The enchantment
            will try to reapply itself every time it tries to create a
            monster. It also will appear if a player says a string with
            the word "gods" in it. (Does not work on Sacred Haven
            servers.) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/28/02
        <ul>
          <li>Decreated the casts per percent bonus for spellcasting to
            7 (was 10). This means for every 7 casts of a spell, you
            will gain a cumulative 1% bonus to improve on future
            castings. An improve still resets this cumulative bonus. </li>
          <li>Changed players to return base max health as their level
            instead of the flat 50. Might want to use it in future
            calculations. </li>
          <li>Increased the default difficulty of a spell with no target
            or a player target to 75 (was 60). For monster-targetted
            spells, the difficulty represents the level (hit points). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/18/02
        <ul>
          <li>Morphed players now show up as red dots on the minimap.
            They also do not show friend/foe colors. </li>
          <li>Morphed players are now prevented from casting Illusionary
            Form. </li>
          <li>Casting Morph will remove an Illusionary Form. </li>
          <li>Players are now prevented from casting Evil Twin on
            themselves. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/17/02
        <ul>
          <li>Prevented Shadowform from affecting someone with
            DRAWFX_SECONDTRANS effect. This is the effect used for
            "stone" things (like stone trolls). Combining these spells
            caused the player's icon to disappear. </li>
          <li>Lowered the effectiveness of Glow. Now gives approximately
            2/3rds the light it did before. This falls more in line with
            the description of the spell, which says it allows the spell
            to glow like a torch. Allows Night Vision to have a use
            again. </li>
          <li>Increased the duration of Night Vision to approximately
            3-4x what it was before. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/16/02
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminated councilor scandals (shifts to neutral) from
            happening during Frenzy. </li>
          <li>Made it so that only one councilor at a time have a
            scandal. </li>
          <li>DM spell Deliverance now only clears a player's honor
            string if it contains the string (resource) from the Damn
            spell. </li>
          <li>Added gems to Cave Orc treasure table. Matches monster's
            description. </li>
          <li>Raised player's stat cap to 70 (was 50). This allows stat
            bonuses to give bonuses to people that go over 50 in a stat.
          </li>
          <li>Reduced the rate at which your karma changes for killing
            monsters of the opposite Karma that move your Karma towards
            neutral to 2/3 what it was before. (For example, if you're
            at -50 Karma and you kill a monster with 30 Karma, the
            change to -30 Karma will be slower). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/15/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that shattering a Riija swords gives the victim
            3 random components (only 1 component is shattered). Each
            component is labelled with the quester of the original
            sword. </li>
          <li>Fixed it so that a player that forgets defensive skills
            can't use them in combat. Also changed parry to not work
            when a player cannot attack. </li>
          <li>Slightly reduced overall chance to hit in combat. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/11/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed the Ukgoth puzzle to open Martyr's Battleground to
            allow Truce to be cast instead of Martyr's Battleground on
            Sacred Haven. </li>
          <li>Server now sends information for the friend/foe color
            options in the client for guilds. You can see guild mates,
            mutual guild enemies, and mutual guild allies in the minimap
            area. </li>
          <li>Eliminated the ability to use a name like "a/an (monster
            name)". </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>11/9/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made wedding rings unshatterable and unswappable. </li>
          <li>Added a small defense bonus to wedding rings. </li>
          <li>Made it so that monsters with pbDontDispose set will not
            affect the karma of a player that kills the monster. A
            monster that does not affect Karma will return nil ($) when
            queried with GetKarma. </li>
          <li>Changed Evil Twin to not affect Karma. (Its base Karma is
            set to $.) </li>
          <li>Changed other objects to adjust to the new possibility of
            getting nil Karma. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/22/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made Xeochicatl able to go through walls. Prevents them
            from getting stuck into stupid locations and unable to get
            out (thus easy to kill). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/28/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed function name for the message that modifies
            defense damage to ModifyDefenseDamage (was ModifyDamage).
            Caused a conflict in guantlets which were also an attack
            modifier that used ModifyDamage to add damage to a weapon. </li>
          <li>Modified maximum defense bonus a shield can give in
            conjunction with the Block skill. </li>
          <li>Increased defense bonus Umbrella gives to 100 (was 50). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/26/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made non-illusionary fire and lightning wall elements add
            a little light to the room they are cast in. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/19/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that the max advantage one side in an
            unrestricted war can have is 25% (was 50%). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/17/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed problem with Artifice not cleaning up timers
            correctly. </li>
          <li>Changed string literals to resources for the teacher
            strings in monster.kod. </li>
          <li>Made the offering quests not available to newbies. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/13/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed problem with morphed players sending an article if
            they are ignoring a person. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/11/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Mana Bomb to be castable on Sacred Haven servers.
            Added in an additional check so it won't affect players when
            cast by other players on SH servers. </li>
          <li>Changed Xeochicatl to lose half their mana when affected
            by Mana Bomb. Also eliminated their mana drain while
            affected by mana bomb. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/9/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed problem of Cure Poison causing additional vigor loss
            when repoisoned with a weaker poison. </li>
          <li>Changed Dragonfly Queens and Kriipas so you cannot morph
            to them. </li>
          <li>Changed Morph to ignore monster restrictions for DMs that
            name a monster. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/9/02
        <ul>
          <li>Removed mutant ants and scorpions as possible insects to
            kill for the newbie disciple robe quest. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/5/02
        <ul>
          <li>Reflections and Evil twins now check AllowPlayerAttack
            instead of CheckStatusAndSafety. A much more comprehensive
            check, including arena checks and room checks. </li>
          <li>Fixed Mana bomb to check for valid for individuals
            affected instead of for the whole room. No longer makes you
            an outlaw for merely casting the spell, but will make you an
            outlaw for affecting an innocent with your safety off. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/4/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed static strings in ladephen.kod and system.kod to
            resources for localization. </li>
          <li>Made it so that moving to a new room will ease the limits
            on the "imp cap". Helps sort out botters from non-botters.
            Also made it so that people at the "imp cap" don't gain
            quite as much cumulative bonus to gain improves. </li>
          <li>Reduced Distilled potion's duration to 1-7 days (used to
            be 2-20 days). </li>
          <li>Added a message to the winner of the Assassin's game if
            they get a prize. </li>
          <li>Lowered chance to improve for all spells and skills in
            Spring of Vitality by 1/3. Tends to be a popular botting
            spot. </li>
          <li>Fixed it so that monsters no longer travel across zone
            boundaries. If they normally would, they either stay where
            they are or move to a spawn point in the room (if a monster
            room). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/3/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made dm blank completely undetectable to other clients.
            Server keeps track of blanked admin, but does not report any
            blank admin movement updates to other clients. Server still
            sends information to the admin, about room movement,
            however, and can still interact with the room. </li>
          <li>Added prStandardIcon to DMs. If not NIL, it will set the
            admins' icon this this resource and set pbMorph. Allows
            admins with non-standard icons to go blank and back easier.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/3/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed incorrect sound resource file name in Artifice. </li>
          <li>Fixed problem with storage boxes not recording number
            items correctly. </li>
          <li>Fixed problem with exotic tops not matching skin color
            correctly. </li>
          <li>Fixed problem with Free Action making certain types of
            hold last forever. </li>
          <li>Eliminated wall element message spam when not affecting a
            player. Walls now count someone as "affected" if even if
            something fails to affect them. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/2/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made wall spells harmful again. Will prevent casting in
            "safe" areas. </li>
          <li>Removed bug that caused scrolls to turn innocents into
            outlaws if an unattackable person is in the room. </li>
          <li>Removed vigor loss caused by running through detection
            items like wall spells, guild hall detector plates, etc. </li>
          <li>Changed Haste's state value to record spellpower instead
            of 100-spellpower. Also changed the vigor calculations to
            match this change in state. Is more logical this way. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10/1/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made all unvaultable items unwrappable by Rycksher in the
            Duke's Ballroom. </li>
          <li>Made Riija sword vaultable if the owner and the questor
            are the same person. </li>
          <li>Made Riija sword not disposible when rooms clean up. </li>
          <li>Made Riija swords practically never hit unless wielded by
            original questor. </li>
          <li>Made Riija swords wear down faster but not break in the
            hands of someone besides the original owner. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/29/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a problem with shadowform and targetting a
            non-player (IE, monster). </li>
          <li>Changed Chalice of Rain to be an item cast. No longer does
            the animation or gives you a chance to improve. </li>
          <li>Changed the spell casting weapon attribute to be an item
            cast. No longer does the animation or gives user a chance to
            improve in the spell. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/26/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added purple mushrooms to Orc Wizard treasure table.
            (Reduced chance to drop disciple's robes). </li>
          <li>Tokens dropped in rentable rooms now automatically
            teleport out immediately. </li>
          <li>Added node to Avar Village (RID_KE4). It appears by
            dropping food in front of the statue (good), or killing
            enough avars (evil). Node cannot be bonded by people of the
            opposite alignment (IE, the node that shows up after
            dropping food cannot be bonded by someone with negative
            Karma, etc). </li>
          <li>Dramatically increased the damage on Illusionary Firewall,
            Firewall, Ring of Flames, and Lightning Wall. 100-150%
            increase in damage for the various spells. </li>
          <li>Increased damage on Illusionary Wounds. Against players,
            now does spellpower% of 17 + ((50 - victim's intellect)/10).
            (Previously, did 10 + ((60 - victim's intellect)/10).)
            Against monsters, it now does about 7 more points of damage
            each hit. </li>
          <li>Reduced post-cast timer on Lightning Bolt to 2 seconds
            (previously 3 seconds). </li>
          <li>Reduced casting time for Discordance to 1 second.
            (Previously, was 1.5 seconds.) </li>
          <li>Fixed bug in Sandstorm that wasn't killing people. Changed
            Sandstorm so it doesn't kill a player, it will only take
            them down to 1 hit point. </li>
          <li><b>Patched the live servers.</b> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/25/02
        <ul>
          <li>Heartstones given to the designers in rentable rooms are
            now stored in the room instead of the decorator. This means
            that someone giving heartstones to the decorator can leave
            and come back and still have the heartstone credit. </li>
          <li>Replaced the literal strings from the Arena and Watcher in
            Tos with resources that can be localized. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/24/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Frular's trigger word for rent to a string
            resource. </li>
          <li>Changed the innkeeper's trigger words for renting rooms
            and copying keys to string resources. </li>
          <li>Fixed an error with the ItemAttPKPointer not allowing NPCs
            to buy items correctly. </li>
          <li>Limited maximum rent time in a rentable room to 240
            Meridan days (about 20 offline days.) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/23/02
        <ul>
          <li>Created War event. It's an event run during frenzies.
            Players are divided into sides which can fight against each
            other. Game keeps score, which is gmailed to a person at the
            end of it all. </li>
          <li>Created War join pendants. Using one of these will align
            you with a side during war event. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/22/02
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced casting time on Mana Focus to 7 seconds (was 10
            seconds). </li>
          <li>Added the ability to set a prize in the Assassin's Game.
            SetPrize(what=$) sets the prize for the assassin's game,
            given to the last surivivor. </li>
          <li>Set it so that immortals cast at full spellpower. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/20/02
        <ul>
          <li>Tanktops now fix themselves to be the correct skin color
            when worn. </li>
          <li>Removed string literals from the shrunken head. Also added
            in a few easter eggs (now eat spider eyes if the owner has
            some, will chat with other shrunken heads the owner has). </li>
          <li>Made silence an aggressive spell (will turn you orange if
            you cast it with innocents in the room.) This is to remove
            the truce/silence exploit. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/18/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added arena checks to the AllowPlayerAttack check. </li>
          <li>Lowered minimum duration of web's hold to 1 second (was 2
            seconds). </li>
          <li>Made Distill's potion power dependent on the Distill
            percent instead of spellpower. The lack of requirement of an
            instrument skewed the spellpower lower than necessary. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/17/02
        <ul>
          <li>Cleaned up wall spells. Made them check for valid attacks
            and consider safeties when affecting other players. Active
            wall elements were made a subclass of a new class
            ActiveWallElement. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/16/02
        <ul>
          <li>Halved the possible penalty in hit points for taking a
            Potion of Forgetfulness for Weaponcraft. </li>
          <li>Made newsglobes unreadable from a distance. Now checks to
            see if player is in the same room, if not it logs the event
            and denies a view of the news. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/14/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added "Rescue" functionality when you use the Chalice of
            Rain. Starts with 4-5 "hits" and is destroyed when used up.
          </li>
          <li>Reduced Chalice of Rain weight and bulk to 20 (was 40). </li>
          <li>Made Chalice of Rain so that a player can only hold one.
            Any others picked up are deleted (and the Chalice is
            refilled. </li>
          <li>Made Chalice of Rain so it is unvaultable. </li>
          <li>In order to get the Chalice of Rain from the cave, you
            must now dispell illusion in addition to killing all the
            orcs in the cave. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that neutral faction members can rip down
            flags from anywhere. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/13/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made Box and Chest subclasses of new class StorageBox.
            This helped eliminate some duplicate code. </li>
          <li>Added in checks so that people cannot interact with chests
            from a distance. </li>
          <li>Added Rescue potions. Only available via creation by
            Distill. </li>
          <li>Added Eagle Eyes potion. Creatable from Distill. </li>
          <li>Changed Eagle Eyes to give a 1 point damage bonus with
            ranged weapons. </li>
          <li>Lowered spellpower for found spell items to 30-60 (was
            40-75). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/10/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Blood Inheritance to give perma-unholy damage
            enchantments 70% of the time. There is a 10% chance each to
            create a Paralyzer, Blinder, or Vamper weapon. </li>
          <li>Made it so that you can not pick up another shadow amulet
            if you already have one equipped. </li>
          <li>Made is so that Amulets of Shadow will not try to unuse
            themselves if someone tries to use another necklace. </li>
          <li>Reduced the casting time on Earthquake to 5 seconds (was 7
            seconds). </li>
          <li>Increased the base damage range on Earthquake to 5-9 (was
            2-6). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/5/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed error messages relating to the purging (Psychochild)
            weapon attribute. </li>
          <li>Fixed Living Trees to follow combat restrictions for their
            lightning bolts (truce, inns, etc). Also fixed Xeochicatls
            to follow same restrictions for their spells. </li>
          <li>Added check for Anonymous or Morphed players in
            CheckStatusAndSafety in Player class. Attacking a person
            that is Anonymous or Morphed should not trigger any
            penalties now. </li>
          <li>Removed ability for unguilded players to cast spells on
            guilded targets towns if the target has attacked another
            player "recently". </li>
          <li>Unguilded non-murderer casters can now no longer cast Jig
            in towns. </li>
          <li>Classified Evil Twin as a harmful spell so that it cannot
            be cast on bad targets in towns. </li>
          <li>Stopped Evil Twin from turning a player outlaw in the
            arena. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>9/3/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Shatter. Amount of number items shattered now
            varies a bit more widely, but can shatter the whole stack on
            a good cast. Will always shatter at least one item in a
            stack, this is to prevent the ability to infinitely cast
            shatter on a single number item. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/27/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added resources in addition to string literals for the dm
            commands. </li>
          <li>Added resources in addition to string literals for the
            admin commands. </li>
          <li>Adjusted the probabilities for types of item created when
            a special item is created. Made scimitars a bit rarer,
            longswords a bit more common, etc. Falls in line with the
            usefulness and desirability of the item. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/25/02
        <ul>
          <li>Increased the hps/mana that "dm boost stats" returns. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/15/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added Kriipa claws to the Dragonfly treasure table (the
            same table the Kriipas use). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8/14/02
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced base duration of Resist Magic to 1 2/3-5 minutes
            (was 5-10 minutes). </li>
          <li>Blind no longer affects immortal admins. </li>
          <li>Fixed bonksticks, don't allow on non-users or self. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/22/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added parameter to DoHold in Hold so that it can choose to
            check for free action or not. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/16/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a problem with Free Action being passed in nil as a
            duration. </li>
          <li>Made the math a bit friendlier so that Eagle Eyes and Free
            Action can resist Blind and Hold completely a bit more
            often. </li>
          <li>Increased Free Action's duration to 3-8 minutes (was 1-2
            minutes). This is more in line with the damage resist spells
            (Withstand Fire, etc). </li>
          <li>Increased Eagle Eye's duration to 2-5.3 minutes (was 2-4
            minutes). This is about half the duration of a damage resist
            spell, since it also gives a bonus to-hit with bows. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>7/11/02
        <ul>
          <li>Cleaned up the text additions for player-enchanted
            weapons. </li>
          <li>Removed chests as possible items in rentable rooms if node
            attacks are not activated. </li>
          <li>Moved the room decorator's commands to resources instead
            of text strings. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/20/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added in Jonas rumors to the political rumormongers. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/16/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that Evil Twins are deleted when their target
            is destroyed. The spell actually removes the trance spell
            from the caster if the caster is a player. </li>
          <li>Increased durability of clothing items by about 5x across
            the board. Durability is now comparable to a robe. </li>
          <li>Made Magic Spirit Helmets unshatterable. </li>
          <li>Made room keys unshatterable. </li>
          <li><b>Patched the live servers.</b> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/15/02
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminated the chance to spawn a revenant from an enemy in
            a mutually declared guild war. </li>
          <li>Reduced the chance for a gnarled staff to not disrupt a
            player down to 12.5% [1 out of 8] (was 25%, [1 out of 4]). </li>
          <li>Made revenants a bit weaker if they are fought when first
            created (IE, before a player leaves the room). Initial
            revenants will have 110% of the target's hps and have a
            difficulty of the target's hps/12, bound between 4 and 9.
            (Normal revenants have 150% of the target's hps and a
            difficulty of the target's hps/10, bound 4 to 10). </li>
          <li>Added clarifying text to the Assassin's Game description
            signs. </li>
          <li>Added the Necklace of Jala as a 1% drop to the Lupogg
            King. Reduced the drop chance for a Fine Lute. </li>
          <li>Added some new constants to blakston.hhd. RID_JAS_WEST =
            RID_JASWEST, RID_JAS_EAST = RID_JASPER, and RID_BARLOQUE =
            RID_BAR_SOUTH. </li>
          <li> <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/13/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bug that allowed items set as undroppable from
            dropping while casting Feign death. The spell wasn't sending
            the correct parameters to one of the checks. </li>
          <li>Made it so that Feign Death wouldn't cause you to drop
            your Riija Sword. </li>
          <li>Fixed a slight bug in RoomKey so that it won't allow the
            key to be dropped without knowing where it will be dropped
            into (IE, returns FALSE if it requests to be NewHeld into
            $). </li>
          <li>Added more event types for BreakTrance in spells. New
            events are more precise about why the spell is being
            stopped. </li>
          <li>Added functionality in Jala spell class so that the
            Necklace of Jala will stop disruptions based on getting hurt
            or making an attack. Also gives a 50% chance to avoid
            disruption (from the Flash spell or gnarled staff item). Jig
            and Spellbane do not have the disruption protection due to
            the nature of the spells. </li>
          <li>Changed necklace of Jala to not be equipable with another
            instrument. </li>
          <li>Changed Silence to allow caster to attack others and
            maintain spell. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/12/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed problem of wands not working correctly in towns if
            both parties were guilded and/or a murderer. </li>
          <li>Fixed problem of harmful room effect scrolls not turning
            the user outlaw. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/11/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made Assassin's daggers automatically miss if the target
            is held/blind/dazzled. </li>
          <li>A successful assassin's attack will now remove
            Invisibility and Shadow Form from the attacker. </li>
          <li>Fixed the problem of people not going visible when
            invisibility was removed from them via a spell (purge,
            dispel illusion, etc). Players now send SomethingChanged
            when they have their flags updated. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/10/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added in safety checks for Reflections. Works the same as
            the checks with Evil Twin. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/9/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed an error causing Trance to try to "Deflect" itself
            instead of the spell it is trying to cast. </li>
          <li>Raised max number of cheating logs recorded to 25 (was
            10). </li>
          <li>Fixed problem of narthyl worms trying to drain vigor in
            monster characters. </li>
          <li>Fixed problem with NPC chatter triggering the music
            changing routine in Duke5 (the ballroom). </li>
          <li>Changed it so that you only need 1 spell/skill in a
            particular level and school in order to automatically be
            able to learn other spells/skills in that level/school IF
            the level is 3rd or higher. Previously, it required 2 or
            more spells/skills for any level. So, for example, if you
            have 1 spell in 4th level Faren, you automatically qualify
            to learn any other 4th level Faren spell. However, for 2nd
            level Faren you need 2 or more spells to automatically
            qualify, otherwise you must meet the requirements for
            percents in level 1 Faren. </li>
          <li>Lowered faction bonuses for to-hit, learning (improves),
            and regen bonus. Raised the defense bonus. </li>
          <li>Added a 20% bonus to improve in the Mender's shop in Tos.
          </li>
          <li>Made Dark Angels track (and properly delete) their
            reflections and evil twins they cast. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/8/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed error in Lore object that caused statues to not
            update correctly. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6/6/02
        <ul>
          <li>Improved the initial chance for Bolt Spells (Fireball,
            etc) to improve to 7% (was 5%). </li>
          <li>Fixed grammar error for a "soldier of the Princess' army".
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/27/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Sweep so that immortals will now pick up all items
            available. </li>
          <li>Reduced the improve penalty for knowing spells outside the
            school. Now calculates the penalty based on how many levels
            you have, not how many percents you have. </li>
          <li>Also eliminated the "bonus" you got for knowing spells in
            the school. This bonus was meaningless and more or less
            eliminated the penalty for getting higher in the school. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/25/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that anyone attacking anything during a
            frenzy goes red (so that the killer messages show up
            properly) and safeties are ignored to prevent problems with
            after-frenzy safety checks. </li>
          <li>Got rid of "mule timer" check during frenzies. </li>
          <li>Changed Roq's commands to resources instead of strings.
            Easier to localize. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/23/02
        <ul>
          <li>Lowered the max penalty for a portal of life target to 80%
            (was 100%). This means that the spell will always at least
            partially benefit the target. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/20/02
        <ul>
          <li>Lowered reagent cost of Cure Disease to 3 Herbs, 2
            Elderberries (was 5 herbs, 3 elderberries). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/18/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed the damage type of Spiritual Hammer and gave it a
            to-hit bonus passed in during creation. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/12/02
        <ul>
          <li>Improved the to-hit bonus for Forces of Light. Now adds
            50+iSpellPower to hit (was iSpellPower/3 + 10). </li>
          <li>Increased the base bulk and weight players can hold to
            1700 (was 1500). Also moved values from User to Player
            class. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/10/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed Evil Twin to not turn you orange upon casting. The
            evil twin itself now checks for status when attacking. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/9/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that the lore object (the object that controls
            the statues on the island) can exclude certain people (EG
            event characters). This prevents a buffed event character
            from taking a statue. </li>
          <li>Added the old Duke art to the art archive. Use "dm
            disguise duke" or "dm disguise Kalior" to look like the old
            Duke. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/7/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that the Spell superclass now checks the
            returned value from GetTranceTime. This will return 0 for
            admin characters. </li>
          <li>Overrode GetTranceTime for spells that use the casting
            time to catch things said. These spells include Morph,
            Engrave, Elusion, and Distill. </li>
          <li>Fixed problem of faction soldiers causing a problem when
            playing their death sound. </li>
          <li>Made it so that non-monster NPCs won't keep items that are
            given (IE sold) to them. </li>
          <li>Added a message "DeleteHolding" in class Holder that
            deletes everything in the holder's inventory. Code was moved
            from the Delete message (and replaced with a call to the new
            message). As a precaution, it won't delete players, only
            send them to a safe location. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5/3/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that black daggers (assassin's game weapons)
            don't count as weapons in the Ko'catan town check for
            "contraband". </li>
          <li>Disabled logging of people "moving too fast" while not
            running. Created too many false positives. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/30/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a problem in the West Tower guild hall in Ko'catan
            (RID_GUILDH12). It would not allow guild allies to enter the
            hall. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/28/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made room keys unswappable. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/23/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed Cure Poison to work when it removes the poison. </li>
          <li>Added Narthyl Worm as possible "prize" from the crate in
            the basement of Castle Victoria. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that the Kraanan, Shal'ille, Qor, and Riija
            temples now give a slight bonus to improves in their
            respective spell schools. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/21/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that calling DoHold in the Hold spell object
            now takes iDuration as a parameter, which is expressed in
            milliseconds. Before could only take duration in whole
            seconds. </li>
          <li>Changed duration on Gaze of the Basilisk to last a max of
            2.5 seconds max (was 3 seconds). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/10/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bug in rentable rooms where people with rooms at
            multiple inns that paid rent to either innkeeper only
            increased the rent for one room. </li>
          <li>Changed the initial chance to improve Hold to 10 (was a
            default value of 20). </li>
          <li>Changed the initial chance to improve Gaze of the Basilisk
            to 10 (was a default value of 20). </li>
          <li>Changed the initial chance to improve Sporeburst to 15
            (was a default value of 20). </li>
          <li>Changed the initial chance to improve Swap to 10 (was a
            default value of 20). </li>
          <li>Changed reagents for Sporeburst to 1 shaman's blood, 2
            purple mushrooms (was 1 shaman's bood, 2 blue mushrooms). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/8/02
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminated possibility for a weaker Anti-Magic Aura to
            replace a stronger one. As unlikely to happen AND it was
            causing too many redundant checks. </li>
          <li>Made duration for Anti-Magic Aura more random. Duration is
            random half to full of a base of 60 + spell power seconds
            (was random 60 to 60 + spell power seconds). </li>
          <li>Changed period on which Heat does damage to 10 seconds
            (was 15 seconds). </li>
          <li>Slightly altered how spell power is calculated. Items and
            shrines now affect your spell power AFTER penalties are
            assessed and bound to a lower value. Basically, you can make
            up for some of the penalty caused by Anti-Magic Aura by
            using appropriate items. </li>
          <li>Player must now take a full penalty death to get rid of a
            revenant. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that only room enchantements improve slowly
            in Seafarer's Peak (RID_A5) and the Dreaded Caves of Ice
            (RID_ICE_CAVE1). Skills now get a 20% bonus to improve in
            Seafarer's Peak. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/4/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed various problems with different item and weapon
            attributes. Mostly had to do with changes in attributes
            where those without a timer now carry a nil in the second
            element in the attribute list on the item. Some of the
            attributes still thought data was there and tried to read
            off nil data. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/4/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed some error spam related to "made" items not having
            an owner. </li>
          <li>Made free action a bit more able to resist hold outright.
            Currently takes 15% of Free Action's spellpower (was 10%)
            for the check to resist outright. </li>
          <li>Lowered max duration for Gaze of the Basilisk's hold
            effect from 4 to 3 seconds. </li>
          <li>Lowered the base disarm bonus for slashing weapons (axes
            and scimitars) to 0 (was 5). </li>
          <li>Fixed bug causing players to take "real" deaths during
            assassin's game. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that portal of life still gives a minimum
            20% penalty (normal death is 100%, was minimum of 0%). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>4/2/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that you must be killable in order to get on
            top of the crate and rummage around in the open crate in CV.
            This should reduce the number of mules that clog up that
            area. </li>
          <li>Reduced chance to create inky-cap mushrooms on create
            food. Was making the spell a bit too lucrative. </li>
          <li>Capped improves in Raza to 25% for all skills and spells,
            not just weapon skills. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/30/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed detect good/evil so that it doesn't flash enemies of
            the same alignment of the viewer. In other words, detect
            good will no longer show good players good targets. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that each room can now determine what
            spells/skills it penalizes instead of having a generic "hard
            to learn in" flag. So, now auto-discordance rooms can choose
            to only penalize room enchantments, etc. Also able to limit
            all spells and skills to 25% in Raza. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/29/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed it so that the trading post on island is a safe
            logoff point. </li>
          <li>Fixed the system to disable logoff penalties if server
            population drops too far. Was trying to set a timer using
            the logoff delay in seconds, resulting in a VERY short
            timer. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/28/02
        <ul>
          <li>Lowered initial chance to improve for Anti-Magic Aura to
            15 (was 40). </li>
          <li>Lowered initial chance to improve for touch spells to 10
            (was 20). </li>
          <li>Lowered initial chance to improve for Deflect to 20 (was
            35). </li>
          <li>Lowered initial chance to improve for Bless to 25 (was
            40). </li>
          <li>Raised initial chance to improve attack spells to 10 (was
            5). </li>
          <li>Set initial chance to improve for bolt spells to 5 (was 5,
            but attack spells got raised to 10). </li>
          <li>Lowered initial chance to improve for scimitar wielding to
            15 (was 25). </li>
          <li>Fixed Denial. It now does damage when the spell is over as
            intended. Instead of being a constant drain, it now lasts
            for a duration, taking back part of the damage it healed at
            spell's end. </li>
          <li>Raised mana cost for Denial to 15 (was 5). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/27/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed faction troops to use the proper insignia. </li>
          <li>Item Attributes are now removed when an item breaks. This
            allows cursed items to be removed by breaking them. </li>
          <li>Removed casting focus time on spells for immortals. <b>KNOWN
              BUG</b>: This disturbs spells such as Distill and Elusion
            that require something to be said during the trance. If you
            wish to cast these spells, go mortal first. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/26/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed spawning problem with monsters in RID_NECAREA3A.
            Monsters were spawning behind walls, etc. </li>
          <li>Made RID_NECAREA3B hard to learn in. It is a popular "save
            spot" hangout in Brax. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/25/02
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced chance for Battered Skeletons to drop dispell
            scrolls (they were much too common). </li>
          <li>Moved code that checks for ways to "cheat" up Second Wind
            from player to the actual skill. These ways to cheat are
            using a token and using a Ring of Lethargy. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/17/02
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced disposal timer to 5 minute interval instead of 10.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/15/02
        <ul>
          <li>Allowed rooms to be re-rentable. Giving the innkeeper
            money now adds time to your room at that inn. </li>
          <li>Fixed a bug that was causing people casting non-damaging
            "antisocial" spells to go orange during declared guild wars.
          </li>
          <li>Prevent casting of enchantments on players if they are not
            logged on after the focus period. This was causing a bug
            where a personal enchantment could be cast on a logged off
            player resulting in a perma-enchantment. </li>
          <li>Included check for players to find distance offering
            between players. Don't know if it happens, but figured it
            would be a safe check. </li>
          <li>Fixed minor error with touch attack spells so that the
            correct maximum spellpower (99) is considered instead of
            100. </li>
          <li>Made rentable rooms keys only copyable at the inn where
            you originally go the key. Also fixed rentable room object
            to give proper error message when it fails to copy a key for
            a player. </li>
          <li><b>LAUNCHED THE GAME!</b> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/14/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a problem with morphed players in combat. You can
            actually hit when morphed now. </li>
          <li>Increased Jewel of Froz damage done with spells to random
            3-5 damage (was 1-3). </li>
          <li>Fixed EvilTwin to use the caster's safety setting to
            determine color changes. Basically calls
            CheckStatusAndSafety() in the caster, which handles
            outlaw/murder status, guild wars, etc. </li>
          <li>Added ability to customize prices for each innkeeper for
            rentable rooms. </li>
          <li>Added ability to give money to the innkeeper to purchase
            additional days for the rentable room. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/13/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that Create Food only creates one item. No
            longer puts the IA_MADE attribute on the food, so it won't
            disappear. Would like to fix it in the future so that
            IA_MADE can be used with number items like food. </li>
          <li>Reduced cost of Create Food to 2 herbs and 2 elderberries
            (was 3 each). </li>
          <li>Fixed code in rentable rooms to be a bit less insane and
            duplicated code-wise. </li>
          <li>Fixed it so that you cannot advance Weaponcraft skills on
            brambles. </li>
          <li>Fixed some error spam relating to Qorbane/Shal'illebane
            affecting spellcasting monsters. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/12/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Illusionary Wounds into a subclass of AttackSpell.
            Works similar to how it always has, but now it more closely
            looks like it duplicates the effect of another "random"
            spell. Basically, it does elemental type damage without the
            possibility of resists lessening damage. Eliminated casting
            time and increased damage done by the spell. (Duplicated
            spell isn't completely random, code is intended to clump
            together so that it looks like someone casting a certain
            type of spell.) </li>
          <li>Fixed weapon to-hit bonuses to reflect the new combat
            system. High to hit bonus is now 175 (was 10), and moderate
            to-hit bonus is 75 (was 5). </li>
          <li>Increased the range of punch from 1 to 2. </li>
          <li>Added in a 5 unit "bonus" on the range of weapons, touch
            attacks, and attack spells if targetting a moving player. A
            moving player is one that is not flagged as unable to move
            (IE, held) and has sent a move packet in the last 2 seconds
            before the attack. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/11/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Silence into a concentration spell. Caster must
            maintain focus while casting the spell for it to continue.
            Drains 10 mana every drain period. Drain period is 1000 +
            (spell power% of 1000) milliseconds. </li>
          <li>Decreased Silence's initial chance to learn down to 10
            (was 20). </li>
          <li>Fixed it so that Beta potions will not give a player more
            hps than allowed by Stamina. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that you cannot add more spells or skills to
            a player than their intellect allows via AddAllSpells or
            AddAllSkills. These functions are called by Beta potions. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that calling AddSpell or AddSkill on a
            player will raise a skill up to the ability set if it is not
            already past the ability level specified. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/10/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added a value, piServerNumber, in system (object 0) that
            can be set to the server number. This must be set manually,
            and is currenly only used for labelling mail. </li>
          <li>Added a DM flag option so that mail can be labelled for
            DMs and above. It adds [server: ###] to the end of the from
            field, where ### is the server number set in the system
            object. This cuts down on confusion when using one client on
            multiple servers. You can turn on this option by sending the
            message "SetLabelMail bValue int TRUE" to the admin object,
            and can be turned off by sending FALSE instead of TRUE. This
            option is set OFF by default. <b>KNOWN BUG</b>: If you hit
            reply on a labelled mail, the additional tag stays with the
            name and must be deleted before you send mail. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/9/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added code to disallow certain names. Players cannot pick
            the name of NPCs, monsters, Meridian 59 gods, or "guild".
            Also put in a quick and dirty check for swear words in the
            name. </li>
          <li>Added ability to send game-mail to your the guild you are
            currently a member of by sending it to the name "guild". </li>
          <li>Fixed some problems related to FindListElem in the script
            files. </li>
          <li>Made it so that players cannot pick the name of an
            existing guild. </li>
          <li>Made it so that guilds cannot have the name of an existing
            player. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/8/02
        <ul>
          <li>Removed most of the spells the lich teaches and moved them
            to other NPCs. The Qor priestess now teaches Poison Fog, the
            island trade master (Wulfgang zax'Ak) teaches Blood
            Inheritance, and the Riija priestess sells Evil Twin. Shadow
            Rift was left on the Lich for now (mostly because it is
            rumored to have a crash bug). </li>
          <li>Moved Vampiric Drain from the Qor priestess to Maleval. </li>
          <li>Fixed bug that prevented players from casting spells on
            monsters in towns. </li>
          <li>Fixed bug that prevented black daggers from attacking in
            "no combat" areas. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/7/02
        <ul>
          <li>Increased the duration after a suicide you gotta wait to
            get money (and now reagents!) to 5 hours (was 4 hours). </li>
          <li>Fixed Tepal's (Ko'catan tailor) response when you ask for
            mutant ant colors. </li>
          <li>Made Detect Good and Detect Evil available at character
            creation. </li>
          <li>Fixed bug that made both good and evil creatures flash
            when detecting either good or evil. </li>
          <li>Improved descriptions for Detect Good and Detect Evil. </li>
          <li>Raised base defense of Shadow form to 30 (was 10). </li>
          <li>Changed bonus defense from Magic Shield to 25 + (2 * spell
            power) (was 50 + spell power) </li>
          <li>Increased room disposal timer to 10 minutes (was 2
            minutes). This will hopefully help fix the problem of bodies
            disappearing too quickly. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/6/02
        <ul>
          <li>Put in code to kill "flashing", where a player logs on and
            off again quickly to reset the logoff ghost penalty timer.
            The new system keeps track of your "penalty time" on the
            User object. </li>
          <li>Reduced bulk on rainbow ferns to 4 (from 5). </li>
          <li>Reduced weight/bulk on solagh to 4/6 (was 6/10). </li>
          <li>Added in code to prevent selling and buying from NPCs at a
            distance. A cheat tool allowed you to treat a dropped item
            like a NPC and offer items to them. See the <a
              href="cheating.htm">Cheating Detection Document</a> for
            more details. </li>
          <li>Added 5 second post-cast timer on Shatter spell. Character
            cannot attack or cast another spell for 5 seconds after
            casting Shatter. </li>
          <li>Rebalanced treasure drops for Tusked and Daemon skeletons.
            Less scimitars, more variety magical items. </li>
          <li>Reduced the reagent taken to make a potion with Distill.
            Now requires from 4-8x the target spell's reagents (was
            6-10x). </li>
          <li>Changed it so that new players will spawn with the
            reagents appropriate for their spells. Created characters
            and characters that go through the newbie portal start with
            5x the reagents they need to cast their spells if they
            haven't suicided "recently". </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/5/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that dropped items can no longer have the
            "Made" (shimmers insubstantially) item attribute. </li>
          <li>Fixed a few cases of error spam in system. </li>
          <li>Changed Second Wind to not kick in if character is holding
            a token. Prevents cheezy working of skill by standing
            somewhere holding a token. </li>
          <li>Lowered faction bonus for damage to 1 (was 2). </li>
          <li>Made monster damage condition messages bold red. </li>
          <li>Doubled the amount of space available in storage vaults. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/4/02
        <ul>
          <li>Put in universal modifiers. </li>
          <li>Changed armor to reduce max/3 (was max/4) on the low end.
            EG, if armor could block up to 6 points of damage, it would
            now block at least 2 points of damage (6/3) instead of 1
            (6/4). </li>
          <li>Reduced leather's weapon damage resistance from 10 to 5. </li>
          <li>Increased maximum damage absorbed by scale, plate, and
            nerudite armors by 2. </li>
          <li>Lowered reagent costs for many attack spells and bumped up
            damage. </li>
          <li>Bumped up the damage on Shal'illebane and Qorbane. </li>
          <li>Added value piSpawnRate to system to control spawn rates.
            Raise this value to increase the time between monster
            spawnings and decrease this value to decrease the wait. </li>
          <li>Reduced wait for monster spawns if there are multiple
            players in the room, up to a maximum of 5 people. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/3/02
        <ul>
          <li>Set weaponcraft improves back up to one check per 70
            swings due to the intellect improve bonus being added back.
          </li>
          <li>Raised absolute damage cap to 30 (was 25). </li>
          <li>Fixed text descriptions for the news globes to be more
            uniform. </li>
          <li>Increased prizes awarded from tasks given by NPCs. </li>
          <li>Adjusted treasure tables to balance things out and add in
            new resist rings. </li>
          <li>Made gauntlets mendable. </li>
          <li>Made gauntlets able to take about 50% more damage than
            before. Hits now range from 300-450 (was 200-300). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/2/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added designer's globe to Ko'catan inn. </li>
          <li>Fixed problem of socket port not updating if you changed
            the server number in the client. </li>
          <li>Removed reference to "Guide" and "Guardian" from the who
            dialog. </li>
          <li>Doubled unsafe logoff penalties for people that have
            attacked another player recently. </li>
          <li>Fixed bug where Jonas was giving spellpower bonus to
            Kraanan spells. </li>
          <li>Fixed some minor error spam in object dealing with trying
            to get an object's position when it has no poOwner. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3/1/02
        <ul>
          <li>Intellect no longer gave a bonus to your initial chance to
            improve in a skill. Added it so that a high intellect gives
            up to a 50% chance to improve. </li>
          <li>Changed factions in an attempt to balance them again.
            Reduced the "out of power" penalty for factions to -10% (was
            -50%). Gave each faction a bonus that is independent of
            their power. </li>
          <li>Added in speedhack check. Checks the number of move
            updates sent and the (squared) distance the player traveled
            in a 1 second period. If these values are too high, it
            raises a notice in the debug log. Worked to eliminate as
            many false positives as possible. See the <a
              href="cheating.htm">Cheating Detection Document</a> for
            more details. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/28/02
        <ul>
          <li>Capped damage done to the player in one hit to 1/3 of
            their base max hps. This should allow us to increase damage
            overall while not making newbies into one-hit-kill targets.
          </li>
          <li>Removed the 7 damage point cap on "bonus" forms of damage.
          </li>
          <li>Made orc wizards cast Purge instead of Purify. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/27/02
        <ul>
          <li>Decreased the default frequency of node attacks. Now
            happen once every three day, in theory. </li>
          <li>Added in a boolean flag to node attacks that determine if
            Miriana will move or not. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/26/02
        <ul>
          <li>Mints now provide mana based on nutrition value (was a
            flat 5 points). </li>
          <li>Monsters can now be given items which will drop upon
            death. </li>
          <li>You can set the pbDontDestroy value to 1 on a monster and
            it won't be disposed of. Useful for admin quest-type
            monsters. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/25/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that groundworm larva (only) can be attacked
            with a mace (in addition to a hammer) while underground. </li>
          <li>Increased weight and bulk of cheese to 30 (were both 20).
            This brings them in line with other food. </li>
          <li>Lowered the "filling" of a meat pie to 50 (was 55). This
            means you won't get as full while eating them. Also
            decreased average price to 80 (was 100), comparable to
            cheese. </li>
          <li>Lowered the number of swings before we check for
            weaponcraft advancement to 65 (was 75). This should make
            weapon skills advance a bit faster. </li>
          <li>Changed the "improve timer" to be 10 improves every 15-22
            minutes (was 4 improves every 9.5-12 minutes). This should
            allow improves to come a bit more often and a bit more
            randomly while still providing enough limitations to make
            botting "not worth it". Overall, a general increase in the
            speed of improvement. </li>
          <li>Made the "booby prizes" you get for dying with positive
            Karma have the "made" item attribute. This prevents them
            from being sold, to avoid farming cash from high-karma mule
            deaths. </li>
          <li>Fixed it so that Elusion doesn't always give you a chance
            to improve. Must actually succeed before you can improve,
            just like with other spells. </li>
          <li>Made Spectral Mummies a bit tougher. They are now
            difficulty 5 and have 40 hps (was difficulty 3 and 35 hps).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/24/02
        <ul>
          <li>Raised Anti-Magic Aura's level to 6 Kraanan (was 5). </li>
          <li>Increased Discordance's chance to remove Anti-Magic aura
            by 2x. </li>
          <li>Tightened up the duration on Silence. It now lasts longer
            at the low end and a bit less at the high end, but the
            average time has decreased a bit. Now lasts from 5-20
            seconds depending on spellpower (was previously 0-30
            seconds). </li>
          <li>Raised number of blue mushrooms dropped at a time to 2
            (was 1). Also reduced base value to 50 (was 80). </li>
          <li>Lowered number of purple mushrooms dropped at a time to 2
            (was 3). Also increased base value to 60 (was 30). </li>
          <li>Raised number of elderberries dropped at one time to 4
            (was 3). </li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where all weapon attributes were adding a
            to-hit bonus to the weapon equal to at least the original to
            hit bonus. This means that one attribute doubled the base
            chance to-hit, two attributess tripled, it, etc. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/22/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed the client to connect to a port on the server
            that's determined by the server number entered at login.
            This port number takes the form of 59##, where ## is the
            last two digits of the server number, padded with initial
            0's if necessary. </li>
          <li>Added the ability to set the server's caption via the
            config file back. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/19/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed advancement so that overall you can learn a bit
            less than you could before. In general, this translates to 2
            less spell levels than before. At 1 intellect, you can now
            learn 6/4 (was 6/6), and at 50 intellect you can learn
            6/6/5/5 (was 6/6/6/6). Not that you can still learn any
            combination of these, too, so that 6/6/5/5 can also be
            6/6/6/4 or 5/5/5/5/3 etc. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that you need a bit less to advance at lower
            levels, but the curve gets steeper faster. </li>
          <li>Added casting messages for the caster of Minor Heal,
            Hospice, and Major Heal when the target is not the caster. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/18/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed the .roo encryption password. The roocrypt utility
            and client now use this new password. </li>
          <li>Changed the .rsc and .rsb encryption password. Also
            advanced the .rsc version to 3 (was 2). This provides all
            sorts of incompatabilities, so that pirate servers can't use
            our client executable. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/15/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added spectral mummies as a monster. They're newbie type
            monsters, a bit below zombies in the hierarchy of monsters.
            They're 50% translucent. </li>
          <li>Changed the mummy treasure type (TID_MUMMY) into the
            newbie area treasure type (TID_NEWBIE_AREA). Drop chances
            were unchanged. </li>
          <li>Changed mummy treasure to be more appropriate for the new
            spectral mummies. Includes most reagents and most starting
            weapon types. </li>
          <li>Fixed reveal to work on spell items. </li>
          <li>Rings must now be identified. Excpetions are wedding rings
            and signet rings. </li>
          <li>Raised resistance provided by rings of resistances to 50%
            (was 30%). </li>
          <li>Lowered reagent cost for reveal down to 3 orc teeth (was 5
            orc teeth). </li>
          <li>Added text to disciples robes description stating which
            school they are dedicated to. </li>
          <li>Eliminated the resistanc to weapon damage from disciples
            robes. </li>
          <li>Added new icons and text descriptions for the duke and
            rebel insignias on the herald shields. Now uses original
            art, instead of recycled art! </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/12/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed the fey (both good and evil) in Vale of Sorrows to
            be less annoying. They now have 60 hps (as 45), allowing you
            to gain more hps from them. They now wimpy (run) at 10% hps
            (was 20%), making them less of a chore to hunt down. </li>
          <li>Changed the default number of entroot berries created to 2
            (was 1). This effectively doubles the amount of entroots
            dropped in the game. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/11/02
        <ul>
          <li>Adjusted the treasure tables to make reagent drops a bit
            different to compensate for spell changes. </li>
          <li>Reduced the weight and bulk of orc teeth to 3 each (was
            previously 4). </li>
          <li>Added dragonfly eyes to Izzio as an initial sale item.
            Also added them as an additional sale item he can add to his
            pack. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/10/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed the amount of time quest engine considers a
            "recent" failure to 4 hours (was previously 8 hours). </li>
          <li>Added firesand as a conditional sale item on Jogeur, the
            Barloque Apothecary. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/9/02
        <ul>
          <li>Rebalanced reagents on spells to be more uniform and
            understandable. Reagents now have "meanings". For example,
            in Faren red mushrooms are for heat and cold, blue mushrooms
            are for lightning, purple mushrooms are for PKing type
            spells, etc. </li>
          <li>Added Jala necklace. Doesn't work 100% yet, but it will
            allow people to use it as an instrument and not take up
            their hands. Eventually want to make it so that the caster
            can keep Jala spells going while fighting. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/8/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that when teachers give you feedback about
            spells, it includes the name of the spell. Fixes the problem
            of someone saying "lightning" in front of the priestess of
            Faren and her interpreting it as "light" and responding,
            "Congratulations! You are currently qualified to learn
            that!" Instead, she will respond "Congratulations! You are
            currently qualified to learn light." Works for other
            responses dealing with learning spells. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/7/02
        <ul>
          <li>Increased the effect that punisher weapons have against
            murderers and outlaws. These weapons now have 1.5x the
            standard magical weapon bonus against murderers (used to be
            normal bonus) and standard bonus on outlaws (used to be half
            the normal bonus). Weapons still give grave penalties
            against innocents equal to the negative of the normal bonus.
          </li>
          <li>Added purger ("Psychochild") weapons attribute. About as
            common as Blinder weapons. Has a 15% chance per hit to
            trigger a random(25,75)% purge against target. Does not
            appear in Sacred Haven. </li>
          <li>Reduced anti-resistance of shock damage on plate armor to
            20 (previously 25). </li>
          <li>Changed a majority of the armor resistances of
            ATCK_WEAP_THRUST (sword type damage) to ATCK_WEAP_PIERCE
            (arrow damage) as was originally intended. </li>
          <li>Gave chainmail an additional -5 anti-resistance to thrust
            (sword) damage, and a 20 resistance to slash damage. </li>
          <li>Reduced Lupoggs' anti-resistance to fire damage from -20
            to -10. Fireballs were doing too much damage to the poor
            bastards. </li>
          <li>Gave skeletons a resistance to cold damage of 70 (used to
            be 0) and gave them an anti-resistance to fire of 10 (used
            to be a resistance of 70). For Daemon Skeletons, these
            resistances are reverse (IE, resistant to fire, vulnerable
            to cold). </li>
          <li>Lowered Scimitar Wielding's chance to increase, given that
            it's now a higher level skill. </li>
          <li>Increased Fencing's chance to increase, given that it's
            now a lower level skill. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/5/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added new Jala spell Invigorate. Decreases the wait
            between Vigor heals. 1st level, costs 1 diamond and one
            edible mushroom. </li>
          <li>Added new Jala spell Restorate. Decreases the wait between
            health heals. 3rd level, costs 1 diamond and 5 herbs. </li>
          <li>Added new Jala spell Rejuvenate. Decreases the wait
            between mana heals. 5th level, costs 1 diamond and one uncut
            seraphym. </li>
          <li>Added rubies as a conditional sale item from Zhieu B'hob,
            the Jasper merchant. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2/4/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added more songs to the Duke's Ballroom (duke5). </li>
          <li>Changed it so that Jala songs can set a property to
            indicate if they can be cast by newbies or not. Moved this
            code from a special case in Spellbane up to the Jala
            superclass. </li>
          <li>Added 2 new types of lutes for a bit of variation in
            spellpower. Normal lutes now give 20 bonus to spellpower
            (previously 40), Fine Lutes give 30 bonus to spellpower, and
            True Lutes give a full 40 bonus to spellpower. </li>
          <li>Added the new "anti-school" songs for Jala. These spells
            increase the chance for a fizzle when casting a spell from
            that particular school. Newbies cannot cast these spells
            (should probably make it so that a newbie cannot
            accidentally learn Jala).
            <ul>
              <li>Truth hinders Riija spells. It's level 1 and costs 1
                ruby and 2 rainbow ferns. </li>
              <li>Conciliation hinders Kraanan spells. It's level 2 and
                costs 1 ruby and 1 elderberry. </li>
              <li>Civility hinders Faren spells. It's level 2 and costs
                1 ruby and 1 mushroom. </li>
              <li>Sacred Resonance hinders Qor spells. It's level 3 and
                costs 1 ruby and 1 fairy wing. </li>
              <li>Profane Resonance hinders Shal'ille spells. It's level
                3 and costs 1 ruby and 1 herb. </li>
              <li>Disharmony hinders Jala spells. It's level 4 and costs
                1 ruby. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/31/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added the mule timer. Mules cannot cast non-harmful spells
            on a player if the target player has attacked another player
            within the previous 10 minutes. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/30/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed newsglobe spamming. Users can now only post twice
            every 30 minutes on any globe. This restriction does not
            affect DMs or above. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/29/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Mana Focus to give a variable amount of bonus
            damage, instead of a straight 25% bonus to damage. Mana
            Focus now gives spellpower% of the bonus damage specified
            per spell. Currently, the bonus damage for faren attacks
            (the new spells) is 5 points, and the bonus for bolt spells
            (fireball, etc) is 10 points. Qor attack spells get no
            benefit from Mana Focus. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/27/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed it so that you cannot cast any spells that have
            another person (or no person) as a target. This prevents
            people from using tokens to PK without penalty (IE, take a
            safe death instead of a real one). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/26/02
        <ul>
          <li>Casting Feign Death now removes an existing Morph
            enchantment. Casting Feign Death while Morph was active
            confused the combat system, which tried to get combat stats
            from the "dead body" illusion. As an added bonus, if you
            cast feign death while morphed, you look like the corpse of
            whatever creature you were previously. <b>KNOWN BUG</b>:
            You flash back to your "normal" form before you take on the
            appearance of a monster corpse. Not much we can do about
            that. </li>
          <li>Fixed Rescue to eliminate multiple simultaneous castings.
            If you have a rescue timer active, you can't create another
            one via the spell. Also eliminates continuous casting to
            improve the spell. </li>
          <li>Changed Feign Death to give you protection while feigned.
            Gives the spell a use vs. monsters and vs. players that
            don't let go of the attack key. </li>
          <li>Increased the overall protection that Magic Shield gives
            you. Gives you 50 extra points of defense (out of a max of
            1000) to avoid incoming hits, reguardless of spell power. </li>
          <li>Added IsMutualEnemy message to guild objects. Allows us to
            expand the meaning of this in the future as relating to
            guild wars. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/25/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added additional check for faction attack when you kill
            something. Fixes the bug where you avoid faction loss if you
            kill someone in one hit. <b>SUBTLE BUG</b>: This is only
            checked for players, so it is possible to land the killing
            blow on a factioned monster and not lose faction. Rare
            enough that I think we can let it slide. </li>
          <li>Changed Rescue to be more like it's former version. The
            new version puts a delay after the casting of the spell.
            After the delay, you are teleported to a safe spot. The
            delay is reduced as spell power increases, and covers a
            range from 15 seconds at the high end to damn near
            instantaneous. </li>
          <li>Removed the "S/he is holding a lute." message from a
            player's description text. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/24/02
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed Frisconar to sell Solagh if triggered. Code was
            there, but he didn't respond because the flag
            MOB_COND_SELLER wasn't set. </li>
          <li>Added variables to control the treasure drop rate. 3
            variables control the amount of money dropped as treasure,
            the amount of treasure that can be dropped, and finally
            chance for magical items to be created. Each of these
            figures is expressed as a percent of "normal", and default
            to 100. For more information, see the <a
              href="customize.htm">Customization Document</a>. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/23/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added mainland reagents as conditional sale items to
            island merchants at bloated prices.
            <ul>
              <li>Tepal, the tailor, sells sapphires and emeralds. </li>
              <li>Wulfgang, the trading post merchant, sells entroot
                berries, fairy wings, and mushrooms. </li>
              <li>Moxal, the innkeeper, sells purple mushrooms. </li>
              <li>Zala, the apothecary, sells herbs, elderberries, red
                and blue mushrooms. </li>
              <li>Kochtal, the blind bow guy, sells orc teeth. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Turned the interior of the trading post into an "inn" type
            place. Healing rates are increased and allows safe logoffs
            in the room. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/21/02
        <ul>
          <li>Removed the hold component from Holy Symbol, which didn't
            quite work anyway. Seemed a bit overpowering for a spell
            like that to hold every active object in the room, anyway. </li>
          <li>Made it so that Blue Mushrooms are a bit more common and
            Purple Mushrooms are a bit less common. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/21/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed reagent for Elusion to 1 polished seraphym. Made
            casting the spell take 50 vigor. </li>
          <li>Added handy mnemonics for returning permissions on news
            globes. Also added code to print a debug message if someone
            tries to post on a globe without the proper permissions (IE,
            cheats to get access to a greyed out button on the client
            side.) </li>
          <li>Connected island newsglobe with the newsglobes from the
            mainland. </li>
          <li>Added in prevention and detection code for people trying
            to force offers. Prints a debug message if someone tries to
            complete and offer without the second person in the offer
            accepting. This can happen if someone cheats to get access
            to the greyed out button on the client side. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/20/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that purify only has a percentage chance to
            remove enchantments. Works similar to discordance, including
            the anti-clumpy provision. </li>
          <li>Split purify into offensive and defensive versions of the
            spell. The defensive version, which will remain named
            "purify", removes "negative" personal enchantments (a
            percentage chance per enchantment, as detailed above). The
            offensive version, which is named "purge", removes
            beneficial pesonal enchantments (again, a chance per
            enchantment as specified above). Changes below assume that
            both spells start with original stats. </li>
          <li>Reduced Purify's level to 4 (was previously 5). Also
            reduced mana cost to 10 mana (was previously 20). </li>
          <li>Changed Purge to be an offensive spell. Increased Purge's
            reagent cost to 5 emeralds (was previously 2). Reduced mana
            cost to 15 mana (was previously 20). </li>
          <li>Increased life gained from Vampiric Drain from 1/3 damage
            done to 1/2. </li>
          <li>Flagged Forget as a "harmful" spell. This is important for
            Purify to remove it correctly. </li>
          <li>Removed code in Swap which allows it to take the least
            expensive of a group of random items from the inventory of
            the caster. </li>
          <li>Added spell Elusion (originally named "Escape") as 6th
            level Riija. Works similar to the teleportation version of
            Rescue. Allows players to teleport to various towns. Higher
            spellpower means more towns randomly selected from a list.
            High spellpower even allows teleportation to the Island.
            Self-cast only. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/19/02
        <ul>
          <li>Moved Mace Fighting down to 1st level (from 2nd level). </li>
          <li>Moved Fencing down to 3rd level (from 4th level). </li>
          <li>Moved Scimitar Wielding up to 4th level (from 3rd level).
          </li>
          <li>Added rings of shock, acid, and cold resistance. </li>
          <li>Increased the duration of resist rings to 15-30 minutes
            (was 10-15 minutes). </li>
          <li>Changed personal enchantments to prevent people from
            casting them on others in "safe" spots such as inns. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/18/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed defense modifiers (IE, armor) to have reduced
            effectiveness. Moved the bottom end of the random damage
            removed to modifier/4 (was previously modifier/2). That
            means, if a piece of armor has a damage modifier of 4, it
            will now only remove 1 to 4 points of damage instead of the
            previous 2 to 4. </li>
          <li>Changed damage modifiers (IE, armor) to not block spell
            damage so effectively. If a source of damage does only
            physical type damage, then it acts as normal. If a source
            does both physical and spell type of damage, then it will
            reduce only 2/3rds the normal amount of damage. If a source
            does only spell type damage, the defense modifier will
            reduce NO damage. </li>
          <li>Reduced leather armor's initial hits to balance it out
            against other types of armor. </li>
          <li>Modified armor defense bonus and damage absorb values to
            be a bit less effective overall. See the <a
              href="armor.htm">armor document</a> for updated values. </li>
          <li>Modified shield defense bonus and damage absorb values to
            be a bit less effective overall. See the <a
              href="armor.htm">armor document</a> for updated values. </li>
          <li>Changed herald shields to give 10 spellpower bonus to
            spells if they have the proper insignia. </li>
          <li>Made the hit and miss sounds for touch spells more like
            punch sounds instead of the previously annoying casting and
            fizzle sounds. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/17/02
        <ul>
          <li>New attack spells are now sold by Maleval. </li>
          <li>Changed "vampiric touch" to be an attack spell instead of
            a touch spell. Renamed class to VampiricDrain (from
            VampiricTouch), and renamed spell and spell ID (SID) as
            appropriate. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/15/02
        <ul>
          <li>Altered the chance for a revenant. Made revenants a bit
            more likely overall. Simplified most of the calculations. </li>
          <li>Removed outlaw/murder status changes and faction loss from
            attacking an enemy guild that has also declared your guild
            as an enemy. </li>
          <li>Reduced reagent cost of Discordance from 3 sapphires to 2.
          </li>
          <li>Eliminated mana cost for sending over guild channel. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/14/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added third person lute overlay for players holding a
            lute. Infrastructure for displaying the lute is in the
            Instrument superclass and can be applied to any new
            instruments we introduce. Code was mostly taken from Shield
            class. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/12/02
        <ul>
          <li>Renamed the message in Discordance that does the deed on a
            room from DiscordEnchantments to the more standard
            DoDiscordance. </li>
          <li>Fixed the intro text on various spells. </li>
          <li>Made a Resist Good/Evil and Fade unavailable at character
            creation. </li>
          <li>Changed the Attack Spell hierarchy to make way for the new
            "attack" spells. The old spells, fireball, lightning bolt,
            slitherbolt, and smite were moved to a subclass of
            AttackSpell called BoltSpell. These spells have practically
            infinite range and send out a projectile icon. The new
            version of attack spells will not have the icon. </li>
          <li>Moved the code that actually specified that a projectile
            was fired up to BoltSpell superclass instead of the code
            being duplicated in each individual bolt spell. Also
            adjusted projectile speeds a bit. </li>
          <li>Added the new attack spells: Shocking Fury, Explosive
            Frost, Blast of Fire, and Splash of Acid. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/11/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Seafarer's Peak (RID_A5) to remove room
            enchantments directly instead of inefficiently going through
            the Discordance spell. </li>
          <li>Cleaned up Hold and Free Action. Moved the resist code
            from Hold to Free Action, so it's in one central location.
            The code is now in its own message in Free Action named
            DoFreeAction. </li>
          <li>Changed Free Action to eliminate up to 75% of Hold's
            duration instead of up to 100%. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/10/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Create Weapon to provide a bit more consistency in
            which weapons it creates. Also gave it a bit better
            distribution of weapons (added Axe as a possible weapon to
            be created). Finally, allowed the created weapon to have
            more than just half hitpoints, it now has
            (iSpellPower+100)/200% of it's original hits. </li>
          <li>Changed Discordance so that it has a spellpower% chance to
            remove each room enchantment (previously automatically
            removed every enchantment). Will automatically remove 1
            enchantment if there are 2 or more enchantments in the room
            and the chance to remove the spell is greater than 60%.
            Chance is halved against Jala spells. Reduced initial
            improve chance to 5 (was previously 10) and also halved the
            mana cost since spell will require more casts to remove
            effects. Finally, put a 1.5 second casting time on the
            spell. </li>
          <li>Changed Hold's duration. It now lasts a random amount from
            half to full of (2000 + (40 * iSpellPower) ms. Also
            increased level from 3 to 4 (got overlooked during the big
            changes done previously.) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/9/02
        <ul>
          <li>Added a Short Sword Fighting proficiency. Used only for
            the short sword, which is no longer governed by the
            "fencing" ability. The idea is to give players more skills
            to work up. </li>
          <li>Changed Spiritual Hammer to be a bit more useful. Changed
            duration to 10+((50*iSpellpower)/100) minutes (was
            previously iSpellpower * 12 seconds). Also changed reagents
            to 5 herbs and 1 orc tooth (was 1 solagh and 2 web moss). </li>
          <li>Made spiritual hammers undamagable. Doesn't really affect
            anything, just makes them seem cooler. :) Also can't be
            swapped, shattered, or weakened. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/7/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed Dement's reagents to island reagents, 1 rainbow
            fern and 1 web moss (was 2 entroot berries). </li>
          <li>Qor priestess now requires that the player have 4th level
            Riija in order to learn Swap. </li>
          <li>Swap now requires yrxl sap as a reagent. </li>
          <li>Lowered Kraanan requirement for Spiritual Hammer from 5th
            level to 3rd level. </li>
          <li>Made Unholy and Holy Resolve island spells. Added solagh
            as a reagent to the spells. Spells were moved from the
            mainland priestesses to the bone priestess on the island. </li>
          <li>Made Detect Good and Detect Evil more newbie appropriate.
            Remove island reagent from the spells. Spells were moved
            from the bone priestess on the island to the appropriate
            priestess on the mainland. Reagent for Detect Good and
            Detect Evil is 1 fairy wing. </li>
          <li>Made duration on Killing Fields 50+spellpower seconds,
            instead of the flat 2 minute duration of previously. Also
            decreased reagent cost to 3 elderberries and 1 orc tooth
            (previously 3 elderberries and 3 orc teeth) and increased
            max damage bonus to 5 (was previously 4) </li>
          <li>Increased base duration on Haste to
            5+((15*spellpower)/100) minutes (was previously
            2400*(100+spellpower ms). Also eliminated vigor cost for
            casting the spell. </li>
          <li>Fixed the bug with Create Food which assumed that 150 was
            the max spellpower a spell could have. Made it so that food
            is created determined by random half of spellpower to full
            spellpower (was previously random between 1 and spellpower).
            Also increased the number of items you can create from the
            spell, generally based on either spellpower or a small
            random interval and increased the duration of food to
            spellpower minutes (was previously spellpower/7 minutes). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/6/02
        <ul>
          <li>Changed spells to their new level and schools, as
            specified in the proposals on the forum. </li>
          <li>Changed the reagents for Create Food from herbs to
            elderberries. </li>
          <li>Changed it so that you can mend items affected by the
            shroud spell. </li>
          <li>Changed Gaze of the Basilisk so that it no longer turns
            you to an an outlaw for just casting it. </li>
          <li>Added a post-cast delay of 5 seconds on swap. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1/2/02
        <ul>
          <li>Made it so that Mana Focus checks for the casting of any
            AttackSpell, not just Fireball or Lightning to see if it
            breaks the trance. Allows room for adding other attack
            spells in the future. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/23/01
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed Glow to properly add itself to random generated
            weapons. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/21/01
        <ul>
          <li>Added a resource to player to tell the player which random
            node is stripped when StripOneNode is called. </li>
          <li>Limited mana to a max of 250 after casting the Nodeburst
            spell. Should this be moved to player like it is with
            health? </li>
          <li>Removed code to reduce the ammo for failed ranged attacks
            from Winds and Sandstorm. Now taken care of in Player. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/20/01
        <ul>
          <li>Moved the winds/sandstorm check for ranged attacks after
            the "pay cost" check. This means that if the attack is
            valid, the arrow will be already be removed at the skill.
            Makes it easier to allow the arena to NOT remove arrows. </li>
          <li>Fixed message StripOneNode in class Player to remove a
            single random node. It will try to remove normal nodes
            first, but if called with no normal nodes, it will try to
            take one of the special nodes (Fey node or node in Martyr's
            Battleground). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/19/01
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed Nodeburst to only be castable once per game day as
            intendend. </li>
          <li>Fixed Sandstorm and Winds to actually ruin ranged weapon
            shots. The spells now have a chance, based on spellpower, to
            disrupt shots. Gives a message and takes ammo from the
            player. </li>
          <li>Checked in a number of small formatting and capitalization
            fixes. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/17/01
        <ul>
          <li>Renamed class DarkBerry to EntrootBerry. Updated all
            references to DarkBerry in the kod. </li>
          <li>Changed cure disease (again). Updated it so that it only
            altered the state of the disease and gave back lost points.
            A bit simpler, and doesn't reset the duration of the
            disease. </li>
          <li>Renamed Cannibalize spell class to Nodeburst. Changed the
            spell references in system.kod and in the build.kod. Also
            removed all references to depreciated SID_CANNIBALIZE
            outside of blakston.khd. </li>
          <li>Fixed Armor of Gort to not be quite so uber. Armor of Gort
            now reduces damage done by random(0,iSpellPower/25), bound 1
            to 4, points and limits maximum damage to 15 points for a
            single blow for (1+iSpellPower/8) minutes. Also reduced
            chance to increase from 50 to 20. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/16/01
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed the cure disease bug. The spell was putting the
            enchantment back onto the player, but not penalizing the
            stat points. So, when the enchantment expired, it replaced
            the stat points which were never removed. This lead to the
            increase in stats. Change could be made cleaner. </li>
          <li>Renamed Reflect to Deflect. Changed the class name to
            match the spell name. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/15/01
        <ul>
          <li>Checked in my changes for renaming most of the spell IDs
            (SIDs). Most SIDs should be the name of the spell, with
            underscores replacing spaces. So, Resist Shock should be
            SID_RESIST_SHOCK. The only spells currently not following
            this system are multicast spells and withstand fire (which
            is currently SID_RESIST_FIRE). Depreciated SIDs are still
            currently in blakston.khd. </li>
          <li>Renamed CreateMace spell class to CreateWeapon. Part of
            the change in global change in SIDs. Also renamed the file
            to creaweap.kod. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/13/01
        <ul>
          <li>Changed the Barloque Guards' parent class to BarloqueTown
            instead of TosTown. Heh. The princess' guards were on the
            take? </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>12/12/01
        <ul>
          <li>Changed "Bizman" to "Bazman" for the Councilor's Chambers
            in the Princess's castle. Done at Tom BAZzano's request. :)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
