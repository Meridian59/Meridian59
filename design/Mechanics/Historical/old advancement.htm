<P>Implementor's notes: Advancement</P>

<P>These were my goals in coding advancement.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Less complicated math, so that fewer special cases would happen, and
both players and customer service would have a better idea how to advance
and (more to the point) why they were not.</LI>

<LI>Allow the game to better deal with exceptional cases, such as new spell
schools or abbreviated spell schools.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Spell Acquisition</B></P>

<P>I started by making the following example graph: How hard should it
be to acquire a spell at level X? It currently depends largely on how many
spell or skill points you have at the previous level, but the precise number
is extremely cryptic. I based my math on the following stats:</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<CAPTION>
<H5><B>I want to acquire spell of level X. What % must I earn in all of
my level X-1 spells to get it?<BR>
Given information: other spell schools, and my intellect.</B></H5>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>The numbers above assume there are 15 spells in each school. This is
in fact low for the more established schools.</LI>

<LI>Players cannot learn Qor/Shal'ille spells without passing the Karma
check (10 or -10 for every level of the spell). This behavior is unchanged.</LI>

<LI>Customer service can use the following way to help determine advancement
problems: <BR>
<B>send object &lt;player&nbsp;#&gt; playercanlearn skill_num int (SKID#)
spell_num int (SID#) scryer obj &lt;guardian's object #&gt;. </B>This will
tell that guardian what stats, exactly, the player must have to advance.
Customer service can also use the <B>scry</B> spell.</LI>

<LI>Players can always acquire first level spells from any school, without
passing any check other than the karma check. However, this has the effect
of slowing down their advancement. This behavior is largely unchanged.</LI>

<LI><B>Divisions</B> are how spells are divided up - it is easier to learn
spells and skills that are similiar to ones you possess. In meridian, there
are three divisions: </LI>

<UL>
<LI><B>mystic: </B>shal'ille, qor, and faren</LI>

<LI><B>combat: </B>kraanan and weaponcraft</LI>

<LI><B>lore: </B>jala and riija, possibly language</LI>
</UL>

<LI>To get any spell above 2nd level from a priestess, you must do a quest
for her. This is unchanged behavior.</LI>
