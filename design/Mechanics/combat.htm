      How Combat Works in Meridian</h1>
    <h2>
      General Combat Equations</h2>
    Combat is now more standardized in Meridian.&nbsp; Most of the
    combat functionality
    was moved to the Battler superclass instead of being separated in
    the Monster
    and Player subclasses.
    <p>Combat revolves around the Offense and Defense values of every
      battler.&nbsp;
      For players, these values are bound between 1 and 1000, while
      monsters
      range from 1 to 1500 in almost all cases.
    </p>
    <p>To determine chance to hit, you take the attackers offense,
      divide it
      by the defender's defense, and multiply by the chance to hit if
      the values
      are equal (currently 60%).&nbsp; So, for example, if the attack's
      offense
      is half the defender's defense, the chance to hit is half of 60%,
      or 30%.&nbsp;
      The chance to hit is bound between 10 and 95.&nbsp; This means a
      battler
      is never unhittable or unmissable, no matter what the values
      are.&nbsp;
      It is important to note that this equation makes combat more
      hit-centric,
      where it is easier to get skill to hit someone then it is to get
      the ability
      to be missed all the time.
    </p>
    <p>Note that these values can be gathered in-game by use of the
      "evaluate"
      spell.&nbsp; This DM-only spell will give the combat abilities of
      any target.&nbsp;
      This spell should be used sparingly, however, because the
      side-effects
      of combat (such as wear and tear on equipment, etc) will happen
      when the
      target is evaluated.&nbsp; The effect should be small, but
      repeated use
      can cause unwanted effects.
    </p>
    <p>When an attack is made, we start in TryAttack.&nbsp; This is the
      core
      message used for combat.&nbsp; If we hit, we call AssessDamage to
      the target
      (so that it can record the damage) and AssessHit to self.&nbsp;
      AssessHit
      is used by battler for side-effects, like poisoning, etc.&nbsp; If
      we kill
      the target, we send KilledSomething to ourselves, otherwise we
      send DidDamage
      to ourselves.&nbsp; If we miss, we call AssessMiss to ourself (to
      see if
      any catastrophic side-effects happen).&nbsp; We always send
      SomethingAttacked
      to our owner for an attack.
    </p>
    <p>The attacker is responsible for miss messages in combat.&nbsp; If
      the
      attacker misses, the it queries the defender for the reason of the
      miss.&nbsp;
      Right now, defenders can block, parry, dodge or "avoid" (generic
      catch-all)
      an attack.&nbsp; The attacker is responsible for hit messages in
      combat.&nbsp;
      The defender gives the type of damage it suffered and amount of
      damage,
      which the attacker reports in a combat message.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Combat Values for Players</h2>
    <b>If a player is Morphed, they always use the values of the monster
      they
      have morphed into for all combat functions.</b>
    <p>A player's offense is calculated from the following equation:
      (Stroke*3)
      + (Proficiency*2) + (Aim*4) + (Base Max Health*3/2).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stroke is the player's percent in the basic skill that governs a
        weapon's
        use.&nbsp; This would be slash, punch, or fire, depending on the
        weapon.&nbsp;
        This number ranges from 0 to 99.</li>
      <li>
        Proficiency is the player's percent in the advanced skill that
        governs a
        weapon's use.&nbsp; This would be scimitar wielding, archery,
        brawling,
        mace fighting, etc, depending on weapon.&nbsp; This number
        ranges from
        0 to 99.</li>
      <li>
        Base Max Health is the player's maximum amount of hit points
        before any
        modifications (such as from a circlet).&nbsp; This number ranges
        from 20
        to 150.</li>
    </ul>
    The attack modifiers a player has will affect this value as
    well.&nbsp;
    Spells such as bless, or items such as berzerker rings will increase
    or
    decrease this value.&nbsp; The faction bonus and bonuses from the
    weapon
    are also calculated in this figure.&nbsp; After all modifiers are
    applied,
    the result is bound between 1 and 1000.
    <p>If we hit, we poll the stroke for the type of damage we do.&nbsp;
      If
      there is no stroke object, then we query the weapon for
      damage.&nbsp; Note
      that touch attacks are both stokes and weapons in this case.&nbsp;
      Attack
      modifiers and faction bonuses can modify the damage.&nbsp; The
      base damage
      never exceeds 10 damage, Might adds (Might-20)/10 damage (minimum
      of 0),
      Proficiency (for weapons) adds ((percent+1)/20) damage, and all
      other bonuses
      are limited to 7 points of bonus damage.&nbsp; This means that no
      hit should do more than 25 points of damage.
    </p>
    <p>A player's defense is calculated from the following equation:
      (Parry*2)
      + (Block) + (Dodge*3) + (Agility*4) + (Base Max Health*3/2)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Parry, Block, and Dodge are the player's percent in the
        corresponding skills.&nbsp;
        Weapons can affect parry (EG, bows return 0 for parry), and
        shields can
        affect block, and movement (IE not being held) can affect
        dodging.&nbsp;
        The type of blow we're defending against can determine the
        values, too
        (e.g., bows cannot be parried).&nbsp; These values range from 0
        to 99.</li>
      <li>
        Base Max Health is the player's maximum amount of hit points
        before any
        modifications (such as from a circlet).&nbsp; This number ranges
        from 20
        to 150.</li>
    </ul>
    The defense modifiers a player has, such as armor, will affect this
    value,
    too.&nbsp; Parliament bonuses are also calculated into this
    figure.&nbsp;
    After all modifiers are applied, the result is bound between 1 and
    1000.
    <p>If we are hit, our defense modifiers can reduce damage.&nbsp;
      Currently,
      armor is designed to make the player easier to hit (it lowers the
      Defense
      value), but it absorbs damage from blows.&nbsp; Resistances also
      reduce
      damage depending on damage type.
    </p>
    <p>As a note: The message LookupPlayerWeapon will return the melee
      weapon
      the player wields (or $ if they have no melee weapon), where
      GetWeapon
      will return the weapon the player is using, including any touch
      attack
      spells, or it will return $ if they are using punch.
      <br>
      &nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
      Combat Values for Monsters</h2>
    Monsters were changed to be able to define raw offense and defense
    values,
    as well as maximum and minimum damage.&nbsp; However, to save the
    time
    of retrofitting all the existing monsters, the monsters can use the
    existing
    viLevel and viDifficulty values to define the values.
    <p>A monster's offense is piOffense, or (3*viLevel) +
      (60*viDifficulty)
      if that variable is $.
      <br>
      A monster's defense is piDefense, or (3*viLevel) +
      (60*viDifficulty)
      if that variable is $.
      <br>
      A monster's damage is random(piMinDamage,piMaxDamage), or 80-120%
      of
      viLevel/Random(10,15) if those values do not make sense (EG, are
      $, or
      Min is greater than Max, etc).
    </p>
    <p>The damage value code is a bit unsteady, so it is recommended you
      do
      NOT change the values if the monster is in combat.&nbsp; It is
      also recommended
      that you pay careful attention to the values, and make sure they
      make sense
      (IE, piMinDamage is less than piMaxDamage).
    </p>
    <p>In combat equations, monsters use themselves as stroke objects
      and weapons.&nbsp;
      Therefore, when a battler sees if it can dodge a stroke object, it
      checks
      that in the monster directly.
    </p>
    <p><b>Other numbers:</b>
      <br>
      Monsters can see (4 + viDifficulty/2) units away.
      <br>
      Monsters can attack (2 + viDifficulty/6) (either 2 or 3) units
      away.
