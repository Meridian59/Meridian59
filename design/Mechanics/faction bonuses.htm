    <h3>Unfactioned</h3>
    Unfactioned get 25% of all non-constant bonuses, calculated with the
    power and population of the unfactioned as a whole.<br>
    <h3>Non-intriguing (below 40 hps)</h3>
    Non-intriguing players get small bonuses in all non-constant powers,
    without regard to size or power. &nbsp;These bonus are usually about
    20-30% of the bases listed above.<br>
    <h3>Comments about current bonuses: </h3>
    Fairly balanced. Mana regen was moved to Princess from Duke, and the
    vigor bonus was added to Duke. We&#8217;ll see how it survives contact
    with the playerbase.<br>
    <h2>How the bonuses work:</h2>
    The code for faction bonuses is defined in
    /blakston/util/parlia.kod. &nbsp;The code for the faction games are
    found in the /blakston/util/factgame/ directory.<br>
    <br>
    Faction powers scale with faction power (tokens, territory, etc) and
    faction membership. &nbsp;As power increases, power increases.
    &nbsp;As membership increases, power decreases.<br>
    <br>
    To understand the equations behind these values, you have to
    understand the concept of the "balance point". &nbsp;The balance
    point is where the factions are all balanced against each other.
    &nbsp;This isn't necessarily the point where the factions "should
    be" or are most powerful, but rather the arbitrary point where
    things are split equally. &nbsp;This point is defined in parlia.kod,
    as the variable piBalanceFactor. &nbsp;It is currently set at 25%.
    &nbsp;This means that each faction is expected to have about 25% of
    the power and the intriguing population of the server. &nbsp;It's
    important to note that the balance for the unfactioned is not set by
    this balance varaible, but rather is <span style="font-style:
      italic;">100 - (3 * piBalanceFactor)</span>. &nbsp;For the current
    setting, this happens to also be 25%. &nbsp;The balance point is the
    same numeric value for both power and membership, but has a
    different impact on each part, as described below.<br>
    <br>
    Each variable faction bonus has a base value that it alters
    according to a function of the power and membership. &nbsp;If
    everything is at balance, the system will return 100% of this value.
    &nbsp;As things change, the percent of this value returned is
    altered.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Power</span>:</span>
    Power is gained by the token and territory faction games. &nbsp;Each
    game can provide up to 1000 points for a faction.<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <br>
    If power is less than or equal to the balance point, then the
    percent contributed is defined by the line between -10% at 0 power
    and 100% at balance. &nbsp;In the code, this equation is defined as
    <span style="font-style: italic;">((110 * iPower) / iBalance) - 10</span>,
    where iPower is the faction's power points and iBalance is the
    number of points at balance.. &nbsp;If power is greater than the
    balance point, then the percent contributed is defined by the line
    between 100% at balance and 150% at twice the balance point; in
    other words, you can only get benefit up 50% of the points available
    (at current settings). &nbsp;In the code, this equation is defined
    as <span style="font-style: italic;">100 + ((50 * (iPower -
      iBalance)) / iBalance)</span>. &nbsp;This value is bound to -10%
    at the low end and 150% at the high end.<br>
    <br>
    The goal is that it should be quick to get full power at balance,
    but pushing beyond the balance point gives diminishing returns.
    &nbsp;But, it's still possible to gain a bit of power at the expense
    of someone else's power. &nbsp;This encourages the loser faction to
    fight back (in theory ;).<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration:
        underline;">Membership</span>:</span> Membership is a count of
    all players in the faction who have been active (who have previous
    logged on within a certain period of time).&nbsp; The balance point
    for membership is determined by the total number of intriguing
    players in the game. &nbsp;With the current setting of 25%, this
    means that in a game with 500 intriguting players the balance point
    is 125 members.<br>
    <br>
    If membership is less than or equal to the balance point, then the
    percent is 100%. &nbsp;This means the underdog will always have
    maximum power for whatever they gain. &nbsp;If membership is greater
    than the balance point, then the percent contribute is defined by
    the line between 100% at balance and 25% at 2.5 times balance.
    &nbsp;In the code, this equation is defined as <span
      style="font-style: italic;">((-50
      * iMembers) / iBalance) + 150</span>, where iMembers is the number
    of members in the faction and iBalance is the balance point in
    members. &nbsp;This value is bound between 25% at the low end and
    100% at the high end.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration:
        underline;">Total</span>:</span> The total is the result of
    these two factors. &nbsp;So, if power contributes 110% and
    membership contributes 90%, then the final value will be 99% of the
    base value.<br>
    <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Constant bonuses:</span></h3>
    <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:
      bold;"></span> The lines labeled &#8220;Constant&#8221; above are constant
    bonuses for the faction. For example, the Princess&#8217; followers get a
    small constant discount when buying items. This power does not
    fluctuate with faction power or membership as other bonuses do.<br>
    <h2>Historical view:</h2>
    Originally there were only Duke and Princess factions. Princess was
    focused on spells; she gave you more improves per time period
    (improves had a harder upper limit), she gave a bonus to all spell
    power, and gave a bonus to defense. &nbsp;Duke focused on weapon
    play, giving bonuses to hit, to damage, and to prices. &nbsp;The
    faction powers only scaled by the number of councilors swayed to the
    faction. &nbsp;The strategy was to have everyone join the same
    faction and swing all the councilors that direction. &nbsp;Most
    people chose Duke because it gave more bonuses for built characters;
    the Princess' bonus for improves were not useful to a character that
    was full built.<br>
    <br>
    During <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trinity</span>, lots of
    things about factions changed. &nbsp;First, the Rebel faction was
    added. &nbsp;The Rebel faction got most of the fighter-type bonuses
    whereas magic was divided between the new Duke and the existing
    Princess factions. &nbsp;The Rebel faction was simply too powerful
    with the &#8220;pure fighter&#8221; theme of Weaponcraft and Kraanan bonuses.
    &nbsp;The damage bonus could add up to 3 points of damage (I
    believe) to melee weapons, the same as Duke could before, depending
    on faction settings. It made the faction incredibly powerful and
    vastly popular. Princess was a distant second, with Duke slightly
    behind. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Also during Trinity, the concept of a bonus to improve was added
    during this time, instead of the Princess' old power of allowing
    more imps per time period. &nbsp; We also gave the token game
    another state for councilors to be, "dedicated" in addition to the
    previous "strong" and "weak" states. &nbsp;The territory game was
    also added during this time to add more depth to the faction
    battles. &nbsp;Faction power also became a function of population in
    addition to raw faction support by councilors and territory.<br>
    <br>
    Resurrection saw the rebalancing of the schools between factions.
    &nbsp;Jonas lost Kraanan to focus much more on weaponcraft skills,
    and the damage bonus was reduced. &nbsp;Spell bonuses were
    distributed between the Duke and Princess more evenly. &nbsp;Soldier
    shields were introduced as a high-powered optional PvP event.
    &nbsp;We also restricted the territory game to only be fought
    between faction soldiers. &nbsp;The mana regeneration was briefly
    changed to be calculated AFTER the first lower bounding of the mana
    regen time, meaning that the Duke's mana regeneration could
    regenerate mana faster than otherwise possible without the 5th level
    Jala spell Rejuvenate.<br>
    <br>
    Overall, the damage bonus is viewed as incredibly powerful by the
    playerbase because it could be so large in the past. &nbsp;In
    addition, mana regeneration is viewed as powerful because of the
    faster-than-possible mechanics described above. &nbsp;Players
    generally have long memories of when something is overpowered and
    will stick with conventional wisdom even after it is no longer
    correct.
