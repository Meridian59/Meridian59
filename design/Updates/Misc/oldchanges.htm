<TR>
<TD width=5%>4 Dec</TD>

<TD width=12%>CKirmse</TD>

<TD width=60%>Changed all DM commands to use the DM prefix instead of the

<TD width=10%>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>4 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Added client support for guest accounts. This is a bit too complicated

<TD>Low confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width=5%>9 Dec</TD>

<TD width=12%>AKirmse</TD>

<TD width=25%>Added scrolling textures on walls and floors. </TD>

just outside Cor Noth.</TD>

<TD>Medium confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>9 Dec</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>Changed some DM commands. For example: 'DM good', 'DM evil' and 'DM
neutral', 'DM item &lt;item name&gt;', 'DM monster &lt;monster name&gt;',
and 'DM get &lt;itemtype' (example: DM get reagents).</TD>

<TD>mid confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>10 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Changed the bar graphs to show the actual number, even when it's below
the minimum or above the maximum bar value (example: &gt; 100 mana points).</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>10 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Added animated spell enchantment icons; for example, truce has a waving
flag.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>11 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Added the ability to change textures dynamically (such as the faerie
forest walls).</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>11 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Added flickering lights.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>11 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Added directional lighting (light that appears to come from the sun).</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>11 Dec</TD>

<TD>EHalley</TD>

<TD>Changed package download dialog to resemble Win95 Explorer file copy
with animation. Artwork not final. Artwork does not yet match non-gray
dialog colors. </TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>11 Dec</TD>

<TD>EHalley</TD>

<TD>Changed text input box into a dropdown combo box, which records twenty
recent commands. Commands that are invalid are not remembered, and two
identical commands in a row are only remembered once. Commands generated
by alias keys are not remembered. Should still be able to use edit box
as usual.</TD>

<TD>Medium confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>12 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Added &quot;tellguild&quot; or &quot;tguild&quot; command--sends text
to all members of your guild. Gives appropriate messages if you're not
in a guild, or if you're the only one from your guild logged on.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>16 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Added palette translations, which make objects appear in different
colors. Probably the pants and the character faces will be the only things
that use this feature in this release. The color of palette translated
objects needs to be tested on the ground, in the inventory, while worn
by players, as players move, etc.</TD>

<TD>Medium confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>17 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Fixed the mail and news dialogs so that you can click anywhere on a
row to select a message.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>19 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Changed object drawing routines and added darkness effect for the shadowform
Riija spell. Need to verify that darkness, invisibility, and palette translation
effects all work for objects on the ground, objects in the inventory, objects
in dialogs, players standing, players walking, and players attacking. 
<P>Further, check that your self-view head and 1st person overlays (sword,
shield) turn invisible and dark when you cast those spells, and that palette
translations work on those graphics too.</P>
</TD>

<TD>Medium confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>19 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Players' names should now become darker as you move away from them,
just as the player graphics themselves do.</TD>

<TD>Medium confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>20 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Altered lag death check: a lag of 4-9 seconds at the time of death
should register as a &quot;lag death&quot;, in which case you don't lose
your inventory or your spell or skill %s. This needs to be thoroughly tested
to see if we have picked good numbers for lag detection.</TD>

<TD>Low confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>23 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Don't show invisible players in the guild invitation list.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>23 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Display advertisement AVI files in the character selection dialog.
Clicking on one of the animating bitmaps brings up the Web browser on an
associated URL. If the client does a download consisting only of advertisements,
a different download dialog is displayed, showing the message &quot;Performing
routine maintenance&quot;.</TD>

<TD>Medium confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>23 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Changed wading a little--you should be able to enter or leave an area
with wading even if the wall around the wading area would normally be too
high, as long as the step up you're making isn't too large.</TD>

<TD>Medium confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>23 Dec</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>When you cast illusionary form and change into a non-human, the self-view
face area shows your new form.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>6 Jan</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>The map shows dots only for objects that would be visible in the normal
view, as well as objects within a certain distance of the player.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>8 Jan</TD>

<TD>EHalley</TD>

<TD>Added a spinning cube latency indicator. It spins fast and is red when
your latency is low, and slower and orange/yellow/green/blue when your
latency is high. Right clicking on it brings up a description box. It should
size itself correctly when the toolbar is added or removed.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>8 Jan</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Changed palette. Be on the lookout for missing or unpalettized artwork
anywhere in the game.</TD>

<TD>Low confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>9 Jan</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Changed the map to always draw dots for players, regardless of distance.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>10 Jan</TD>

<TD>EHalley</TD>

<TD>Added a DM ECHO command for Actors. 'ECHO You sense an evil omen.'
will show the message to everyone in the room. This is different from emote
since it doesn't show who sends it. Useful mostly during roleplay events.
Only those DMs with the Actor flag will be able to use the command. </TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>10 Jan</TD>

<TD>AKirmse</TD>

<TD>Don't show invisible objects in look dialog boxes.</TD>

<TD>Medium confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>15 Jan</TD>

<TD>EHalley</TD>

<TD>Package download dialogs should have correct transparent look, even
if user specifies puke green for their Win95 button colors. Should not
appear as a big gray rectangle on non-standard colored dialogs. </TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>15 Jan</TD>

<TD>EHalley</TD>

<TD>Changed latency meter colors from &quot;spectral order&quot; to &quot;stoplight
order&quot;. So a very good connection is green, medium ones go through
yellow and gold, then bad ones are red and purple. Color changes should
be very smooth, using a new dithering feature to draw in-between colors.
</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>15 Jan</TD>

<TD>EHalley</TD>

<TD>Added DM PLAIN (normal), DM BLANK (completely invisible), DM ANONYMOUS
(no name), and DM SHADOW (silhouette effect) for Actors. Note that some
messages will be missing the person's name when they are anonymous: those
will not be fixed. Other messages say 'Someone' if you're anonymous, such
as when you talk or broadcast. </TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>6 Dec</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

a guild hall.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>6 Dec</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>'Fire' was reclassed as a Level 50 skill so that it would not mess
up the learning curve of the skills that are actually in use. &nbsp;This
makes it now possible to gain level 4 Weaponcraft.</TD>

<TD>High confidence.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>6 Dec</TD>

<TD>DSchubert </TD>

comes along and casts anti-magic aura, it will replace the old one if the
new one is more powerful.</TD>

<TD>Mid confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>9 Dec</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>If you kill an outlaw (not a murderer) or an innocent person with a
fireball or lightning bolt spell, it used to brand you and outlaw (not
a murderer). It should now brand you a murderer if you killed an innocent,
and not brand you anything if you fireball an outlaw or murderer. </TD>

<TD>Low confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>9 Dec</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>Forgetpotions have a new graphic.</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>9 Dec</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>Improved failure for shatter and swap - most notably, you get a message
now if you cast shatter or swap and they are carrying nothing (or an item
that is non-swappable or non-shatterable is chosen).</TD>

<TD>High confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>23 Dec</TD>

<TD>CKirmse</TD>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>6 Jan</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD><A HREF="http://meridian58/assgame.htm">Assassin's Game.</A> See link
for further details. While I'm a brilliant coder, this is a substantial
set of changes, and should probably be tested heavier than anything else.</TD>

<TD>Test this to death</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>7 Jan</TD>

<TD>Dschubert</TD>

<TD>Rumors were added to Cor Noth, Marion and Jasper innkeeper, telling

only use them when a match is in session.</TD>

<TD>High confidence.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>7 Jan</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>Arena Tournament mode now requires DM commands instead of 'say' commands.

</TR>

</TD>

<TD>High confidence.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>7 Jan</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>There was a bug where anyone could say ACCEPT when the challenger challenged
the champion (including the challenger!), forcing the champion to fight
someone he didn't want to. Now, only a champion can accept the challenger's
challenge.</TD>

<TD>Mid confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>7 Jan</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>There was a bug where anyone could say ACCEPT during the 30 second

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>15 Jan</TD>

<TD>EHalley</TD>

<TD>Shopkeepers in Tos and Barloque are now under political pressure to
not serve the murderers. When a murderer tries to buy or offer to a &quot;lawful&quot;
NPC, if there are others in the room, the NPC says loudly that they won't
do business with thugs. The NPC also whispers to the murderer that they
can come back alone later, when they can do business without soiling the
NPC's reputation. </TD>

<TD>Medium confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>15 Jan</TD>

<TD>EHalley</TD>

<TD>Added opening and closing messages and graphics for the &quot;book&quot;

<TR>
<TD>15 Jan</TD>

<TD>Dschubert</TD>

c4. Fairy forest tree textures range from very good to very bad, depending
on # of good fairies/# of total fairies (80% = very good, 60% = good, etc).
If all of the fairy forest rooms are either very good or very evil, then
a mana node will appear in C2. See me for more details.</TD>

<TD>Medium confidence.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>15 Jan</TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>Added armageddon spell, which kills all monsters in the room (deletes

<TD>17 Jan </TD>

<TD>DSchubert</TD>

<TD>Changed the way that damage is computed. Previously, resistance/susceptibilities
were multiplied in AFTER attack modifiers such as Jewels of Froz or Bless
spells were figured in. Now this multiplier happens BEFORE. Should result
in most things generally doing less damage.</TD>

<TD>Mid confidence</TD>
</TR>

<TD>CKirmse</TD>

<TD>Added a room hash table to system.kod. All room lookups are performed
using the hash table instead of a list. As of 1/7/97, the list lookup is
still used to verify that the hash table is working correctly, and discrepancies
are printed to debug.txt</TD>

<TD width=60%>Added CanEnchant routine. All three enchantment spells now
check this to see if a target weapon can be enchanted. All weapons should
be enchantable, unless they already have an enchantment of some form. Black
Daggers may not be enchanted.</TD>

<H3><A NAME="addon"></A>To use this system with the Netscape Editor*</H3>

<P>--Outdated, unnecessary.--</P>

<P>* I use the Netscape editor instead of Frontpage because (a) it's easier
to get around in than Frontpage, (b) we all can get copies easily, and
(c) it's far easier to work with tables in Netscape than in frontpage.
