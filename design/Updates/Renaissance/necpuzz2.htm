<P>So, you've solved it once by figuring it out yourself, right?</P>

<P>If not, do <I>not </I>read any further.</P>

<P><B>Solution:</B></P>

<P>while standing on the center platform, cast wall of lightning so that
a piece of the wall is smack dab on top of the center column. It will light
up (turn from red to green) and four red columns will rise up out of the
ground in the four corners of the arena.</P>

<P>A friend down below must cast wall of lightning so that a piece of the
wall is smack dab on top of one of the columns. It will light up. Repeat
for the remaining three columns. When all five columns are lit up, the
central platform will rise up and anyone on the platform will now be able
to make the jump to the north ledge. At the same time, a bunch of skeletons
will be released into the arena from behind secret doors in the rock wall.
While the center platform is raised, a railing will also rise on the south
ledge to prevent anyone from jumping onto the center platform while it's
rising (this is to prevent your friends down below from joining you - it's
impossible to complete the puzzle with just one player).</P>

<P><B>Need to test:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>That it's impossible for the player who activated the four outer pillars
to make it onto the center platform and make the jump to the north ledge.
This is very, very important.</LI>

<LI>That the jump isn't too difficult on an average machine (I can do it
on mine, but jumping distances get shorter for slower machines).</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Now for the second part of the puzzle:</B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>[why is there a second part, you ask? So you can let in
your friends who are still stuck down in the arena! Also, if you're clever
there's a way to circumvent the first part of the puzzle the next time
you want to get into the necropolis.]</FONT></P>

<P>When you make the jump to the north ledge and proceed north, you come
across a bunch of levers. A book lies on the ground near them.</P>

<P>It is the journal of the Watcher of the Arena of Brax, and it contains
the following tantalizing tidbits of info:</P>

<UL>
<P><I>to raise the stands and unleash the undead upon their victims, raise
and activate all the spires.</I></P>

<P><I>A spire cannot be activated or deactivated unless it is raised.</I></P>

<P><I>Five of the levers activate/deactivate one of the five spires.</I></P>

<P><I>Four of the levers raise/lower one of the four outer spires.</I></P>

<P><I>The enchantments which power the levers seem to be volatile; recently
the Watcher pulled an activation lever and it also lowered one of the other
spires. He had to call in one of the Queen's dreaded Order to re-enchant
it.</I></P>
</UL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B>These are all the hints the players will receive.</B></P>

<P>As before, internal testers should not read the solution until they
have managed to solve it by themselves, preferably by figuring it out rather
than by flipping random levers.</P>

<P>Once you've solved it, <A HREF="necpuzz3.htm">here are the spoilers</A>
so that you can test it more rigorously.</P>
