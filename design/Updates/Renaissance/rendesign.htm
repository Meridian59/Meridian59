<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+3>Overview of Renaissance Design Elements</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE=+1>This update has three main objectives: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI>To upgrade some of the older art, </LI>

<LI>To exploit the potential of Revelation's infrastructure additions (quest
engine, weapon attributes), and </LI>

<LI>To add new content which is designed to enhance player-player interaction.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">The art for parts of the existing game will be polished
to match the look and feel of newer areas such as those added for Revelation,
as well as the new areas to be added as part of this update. These efforts
will focus on Tos and Raza/Hazar, the former since it is the most popular
town and the latter since it serves as the demo for the game, and thus
should be representative of its best elements.</P>

<P>During Revelation's development cycle, a number of additions to the
code base were made in such a way that they would be easily expandable
with a marginally small programming effort - this means more features with
less resources expended. For example, the quest engine was written to randomly
generate quests based on simple templates. With a few new template building
blocks and the introduction of a large number of new templates, we can
greatly increase the in-game experience. New quests will include a simple
set of errands for the newbie/demo area and a wide variety of delivery
quests, such as food to innkeepers, gardening supplies to apothecaries,
ale to taverns, and the like. Failure to deliver a shipment will be considered
stealing, and will brand the thief an outlaw (a new quest penalty).</P>

<P>Another new feature in Revelation which has a great deal of mileage
left in it is the ability for weapons (and other items) to have attributes
associated with them. Simple special abilities such as activating existing
spell effects will be easily implemented, and also will greatly increase
the variety of treasure in the game. The same principle of reusing spell
effects for magic items applies to potions and wands as well.</P>

<P>Finally, the centerpiece of this update is the Necropolis, the lost
sister city to Tos, which was buried underground ages ago to seal away
a great evil from the world. A cult of necromancers has rediscovered the
city and its undead queen, and are working to bring her evil back into
the world.</P>

<P>The necromancers are part of an ongoing campaign which the events staff
has been running for months now. When the furor from Revelation's release
has died down, events will resume the necromancer storyline, foreshadowing
the unearthing of the Necropolis and leaking bits of its history to the
players. After the release, players will be able to explore the Necropolis,
discover the ancient evils hidden there, and choose to either fight them
or join them.</P>

<P>Those who join forces with the evil queen are granted special powers
(along with certain weaknesses, of course) and themselves become necromancers,
subsuming the role of the bards from the lead-in events, taking the storyline
into their own hands. The necromancers' affliction is that they must kill
in order to maintain the dark magic which fuels their power. If they go
too long without killing, they weaken and die. In return, when they are
at their strongest they receive certain stat bonuses associated with magic
use (and penalties associated with hand-to-hand combat). Also if they choose
to serve her, the lich-queen's stronghold becomes their own (the equivalent
of a guild hall), complete with defense mechanisms such as a player-configurable
entryway maze. Their existence is tightly intertwined with that of their
queen; if she gains in power, so do they, but if she is slain they all
perish, their cult disbanded until another group of evil players comes
to re-awaken the slumbering undead queen.</P>

<P>Long ago, at the height of the queen's power, a mage of the earth created
a sword which was enchanted to defeat her and her minions. Her power at
the time was too great, however, and his champion perished in the labyrinths
under the lich-queen's fortress. The sword still lies there, duplicating
itself when the moons are properly aligned, and an adventurous player may
brave the dangers of the Necropolis to retrieve a Sword of the Hunter and
take up the mission of that long-dead champion. Becoming a Hunter, as with
the necromancer, affords certain benefits along with some sacrifices. Hunters
receive stat bonuses associated with combat, and penalties associated with
magic use. A Hunter's sword is particularly effective against murders,
especially those who have killed many times; as such, the Hunter is the
natural enemy of the Necromancer. Indeed, the hunter must bring murderers
to justice in order to maintain his ability boosts (although he will not
die for lack of doing so). Hunters also have tracking abilities which allow
them to locate nearby murderers and even (with difficulty) to locate a
particular murderer or outlaw.</P>

<P>The Hunter-Necromancer scenario provides a framework for players to
create their own epic conflict, channeling pk energy away from those who
wish to be uninvolved, and providing a template for those who wish to role-play
an evil character and those who wish to role-play a vigilante (and sometime
defender of the weak). The lich-queen's fortress is a powerful cross between
the guild-hall scheme and 'boss' scenarios such as the Lupogg King's den
and the lair of the Orc Pit Boss. The lich-queen does not awaken unless
players awaken her, whereupon they must protect her in order to remain
alive and maintain their powers. The Hunters (and other good players) will
naturally want to rid Meridian of the evil necromancers, and can do so
by storming the fortress and slaying the lich. The resulting conflict is
player vs. player, so it provides the most interesting challenge available,
and it's a scenario in which players can become emotionally invested, encouraging
role-playing.</P>

<P>At the same time, the roles are grey enough to provide room for complicated
player interactions. After all, the Hunters are vigilantes and have a compulsion
to kill which is not so unlike that of the Necromancers. Truly good characters
might not approve of all of a Hunter's actions. Also, a Necromancer need
not join the Order and participate in the Lich scenario - fearing a security
breach, other Necromancers might hunt down rogues and force them to join
or die (might such a Necromancer then betray his own kind?).

hunger level). </LI>

<LI>Conditions must be satisfied in order to pick up the item (pendant
causes death, sword won't budge). </LI>

that member's rank. If the Master dies through other means, a random member
of the next rank moves up. </LI>

<LI>Periodic tribute to the Lich (analog of guild rent) - periodic quest
or special pk. Unpaid tribute dramatically increases hunger of members.
