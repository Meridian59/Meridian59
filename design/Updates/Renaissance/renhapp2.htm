<P><B><FONT SIZE=+3>What the Necromancer/Hunter scenario means in Happyland</FONT></B></P>

<P>We had a design meeting regarding this matter, to gather input from
all the team members.</P>

<P>(see <A HREF="renhappy.htm">What does the Necromancer/Hunter Scenario
mean in Happyland?</A>)</P>

<P>Support was split between Scenarios 3 and 1 (5 and 2 supporters, respectively),
with 3 winning out.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Scenario Three:</FONT></B></P>

<P>Necromancer amulets and Hunter Swords generate as normal. Hunters and
necromancers must subsist upon monster kills (this will probably involve
rebalancing the nourishment scale). Necromancers can form the guild by
reawakening the lich as normal. Necromancers suffer the usual penalty for
disbanding the guild due to nonpayment of tithe. If someone kills the lich,
the effects are also as usual.</P>

<UL>
<P>advantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>no kod impact at all (aside from tweaking some hunger numbers in the
Amulets and Swords)</LI>

<LI>Preserves the bulk of the scenario intact.</LI>
</UL>

<P>disadvantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>allows players an avenue to hurt each other, which is against the philosophy
of Happyland.</LI>
</UL>
