<P><B>Chapter 1: Waves of Blood</B></P>

<UL>
<P><I>And so they came.</I></P>

<P><I>At first a trickle, and then a flood. Waves upon waves of them, in
an orgy of never-ending bloodthirst, they conquered with ease, plundering
with malice and burning everything left behind them with subhuman glee.
The Twisted Wood, once merely a wary place to tread, became a deathtrap
overnight as the encroaching Orc armies crept closer to the walls of Tos,
until the evil ilk set up their moth-ridden tents within kissing distance
of the gates themselves, in a shameless mockery of civilized man.</I></P>

<P><I>Our men fought with valor, with desperation and with their backs
to the city walls, and the masonry was deeply stained with the blood of
orc and man. Finally, our generals realized that we had barely enough men
left to man the walls, and the retreat was sounded. We ran for the city
gates like craven dogs. I was the last one in. I watched in horror, as
we closed the gates on the stragglers. Their fates were sealed, but at
least most of them had the satisfaction of a quick and painless death.
Those of us inside were not so lucky.</I></P>
</UL>

<P><B>Chapter 2: the Siege of Tos</B></P>

<UL>
<P><I>Tos is the oldest of the great cities, formed by settlers weary of
the barbarity that ruled the land before we were blessed with civilization.
Since the enemy of man was other men, our ancestors chose a place that
was defensible to the north, in hopes that our enemies would be thwarted
by the Badlands to our north. Not twenty years ago, we proved these defenses
were still strong, when we used magic to make the canyon walls collapse
on our Barloqian enemies. Hundreds died.</I></P>

<P><I>Now that we faced a threat from the south, though, this advantage
was turned against us. The other great cities had heard of our plight,
and sent aid, from Jasper, from Cor Noth, even from our mistrustful brothers
of Barloque. But the orcs had the city of Tos surrounded, and were quick
to move a conginent north, where they defended the border of the badlands
by hurling rocks from the canyon walls.</I></P>

<P><I>Meanwhile, in the city walls, we found ourselves on the losing end
of the waiting game. Once the orcs had forced our armies into the city
walls, they blockaded the gates, and seemed quite willing to sit outside
until the time was proper. Inside, we had nothing better to do, but to
tend the wounded, weep, pray, and die. Mostly, we died.</I></P>

<P><I>Water was the first thing to go. Tos was not built near a river -
it gets its water from deep wells fed from mountain streams. The orcs found
those streams, and poisoned them with rotting flesh. We found out when
our children died. </I></P>

<P><I>Then the plague came. Orcs don't believe in burying their dead on
the battlefield when they die, much less ours. And so the smell, and the
disease that came with it, piled over the city walls. We realized this
was happening when our wives and elders died.</I></P>

<P><I>We were sick, tired, grieving, and one shade away from death. Several
times, we spoke of surrendur, and we would have, too, if we weren't so
absolutely certain that they would have killed us all.</I></P>
</UL>

<P><B>Chapter 3: Konima's Return</B></P>

<UL>
<P><I>On the third night of the seventh week, in the middle of the night,
the town of Tos was rocked by an explosion, followed by an earthquake.
I sat up, certain it was the orc's final offensive, somewhat thankful that
the end was finally here, when a child ran up to where we were sleeping,
and shouted, 'It's him! It's him!&quot; </I></P>

<P><I>And so it was.</I></P>

<P><I>From the city walls, we watched, as our saviors, a band of no more
than twenty men, took on the orcish army, who had been taken mostly by
surprise. And our saviors brought with them the sword of vengeance, the
magics of the Gods, and an unrestrained fierceness. Bursts of flame lept
across the sky, leaving ashes where whole squads of orcish armies had once
been. The sun mysteriously shone at the pitch of night, and the orcs seemed
to wither before it's purity. The earth opened up, and swallowed the tent
of the orcish leaders whole. But the most incredible thing on the field
was him. Him.</I></P>

<P><I>I had never met Konima. I was a mere lad when he had left his homeland
of Tos on his great pilgrimage, and yet, there was still no doubting, that
this was Konima. He waded through the orcish hordes, standing a head above
the tallest of them, an ebon blade in each hand which seemed to strike
effortlessly through anything that stood in their way. He was magnificent.</I></P>

<P><I>And we, those of us in Tos, were inspired. So inspired that we, starving,
thirsting, weary, sick and hopeless, somehow found the strength to pick
up our swords and rush outside and press the attack from another flank.
In retrospect, it was a horribly foolhardy thing to do, seeing as is Konima
had the task well in hand, but at this point the orcs were in full retreat.
Furthermore, the main force had retreated to the south, leaving an auxiliary
force to the north - we could take them from behind, and we could once
again get fresh supplies through the badlands from the rest of the world.
Tos was saved.</I></P>

<P><I>We cheered, we clapped each other's heads, we embraced our saviors,
each other, even the trees, the green foliage of which we thought we'd
never seen again. But Konima wesn't smiling, not on this, the day of his
greatest victory. </I></P>

<P><I>He raised his hand, and we all were quiet. And then he spoke. He
said, &quot;Those orcs didn't just appear. They had to come from someplace.
We have to find out where.&quot;</I></P>
</UL>

<P><B>Chapter 4: Sacrifice</B></P>

<UL>
<P><I>The next night, Konima took back the northern pass. He didn't kill
them all, though. He let them escape to the south, and then he followed
them. We watched him go by as we buried the dead on the battlefield. I
didn't expect to see him again, not for months, perhaps not ever. But he
came back the next night. He got all of us from Tos together in the town
square, and he said, &quot;I want you to bury me alive.&quot;</I></P>

<P><I>He led us to where the orcs had led him - to a cave on the eastern
rim of the Twisted Wood, where I had played often as a child. He said,
&quot;There is a gate in there - a doorway into the depths that was somehow
opened. We must close it.&quot; He paused. And then he said, &quot;but
first, I must go in.&quot;</I></P>

<P><I>He was certain that the brunt of the orcish army was within, and
that it was now reinforcing itself. &quot;We can close the gate, but then
they will merely open it again. My comrades and I must strike in the heart
of the orcish warrens. You must seal the door, in case we fail.&quot;</I></P>

<P><I>I said, &quot;but we can't bury you alive!&quot; He smiled, and said,
&quot;Tos is my homeland, nothing is nearer to my heart. If Tos falls,
I am not truly alive anymore.&quot; And then he threw me a wink, and said,
&quot;besides, do you think a mere wall of rock can keep my sorcerers out?&quot;</I></P>

<P><I>And so he gathered the strongest men and women he had: Jeremiah of
Cor Noth. Shal'ille's High Priestess Marianna. Raph Korsten. Melissa Ravenblade.
Garron Damodred. Even old man Froz himself stumbled into the darkness.
And, ever dutifully, a mage mystically closed and warded the gates behind
them. There was weeping, there were best wishes, there were fervent prayers
to Shal'ille.</I></P>

<P><I>All of which must have gone unheard, because we never saw any of
them again. </I></P>
