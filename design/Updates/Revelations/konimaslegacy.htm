<H3><B>Meridian 59: Konima's Legacy</B></H3>

<H5><B>May, 1997</B></H5>

<P>Bards and sages remember fondly the tale of Konima who, with his small
band of stalwart adventurers, drove the orcish hordes from the walls of
Tos, and back into their home. Intent on ending the threat to his homeland
for once and for all, Konima vowed to go deep into the caverns the orcs
called home and eradicating them at the source. However, aware that he
might fail, Konima ordered the cavern behind him sealed shut, to protect
the peaceful folk of Tos from trouble. No one heard from him or the orcish
hordes since.</P>

<P>But of late, troublesome signs have begun. Orcish raiding parties have
begun to harass merchants and travellers. And an adventurer, Joman, has
reportedly been to where the door to the orc caves sat shut for all these
years. The door, he said, was open......</P>

<P><B>New Gameplay Additions</B></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Orc Warrens - </B>An extremely difficult maze, more like a standard
dungeon than anything else. A couple of puzzles, and the mana node that
is in the icky caves may well be moved here. At least two, possible three
new kinds of orc (Cave Orc, Orc Chief, Orc Shaman), as well as a ghoul.</LI>

<LI><B>Konima's Island </B>- The band of adventurers went a long way towards
driving the orc hordes towards extinction, but eventually, the tides turned
and they were forced to flee for their lives. Knowing that the way home
was barred to them, Konima led his men into a new direction, heading upwards
until the survivors of the party found the caves open up to sky, and their
feet on the sandy soil of a small island. With little other options, Konima's
Island declared it home, and made a civilized but dangerous life there.
<BR>
The new Temple of Riija is here, as well as new weapons technology (bows
and arrows) and new clothing options&nbsp;(robes). The economy also evolves
differently, operating around a different currency.</LI>

<LI><B>Riija spells </B>- </LI>

<UL>
<LI>An entire spell school (Riija), dedicated solely to illusion and deception,
has it's main monastery on the island. A full gamut of ~12 spells will
be added. </LI>

<UL>
<LI>Anonymity (1) - changes a person's name to 'someone', and hides their
description. </LI>

<LI>Flash (1) - Causes a bright flash to go off in the room. Any trances
in the room are lost.</LI>

</LI>

<LI>Apparition (3)- creates a 1 HP version of a common monster. </LI>

<LI>Illusionary Token (3) - Creates a fake Duke/Princess token, which will
fool an average player but does nothing to fool a councilor. </LI>

<LI>Forget (4) - Causes the target player to forget a spell for a short
period of time. The spell forgotten is chosen at random. </LI>

<LI>Denial (4) - The player gets healed up to full health. When the enchantment

<LI>Mirror Image (4)- Creates a mirror image of yourself with 1 HP. That
mirror image attacks whatever monster attacks you. </LI>

</UL>
</UL>

<LI><B>Orc Raids - </B>Sure, players can raid the Orc Warrens. The Orcs
will also be raiding Tos, laying siege and preventing all comers from entering
the town. As a result, the town will suffer for the siege, largely in the
form of higher prices and unsafe streets.</LI>

<LI><B>More Clothing and Hair options </B>- Robes will be available, as
will different colored shirts.</LI>

<LI><B>Lair of the Lupogg King -</B> The tunnels beneath Barloque and Jasper
