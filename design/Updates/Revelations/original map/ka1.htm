<P>
The Dragonfly Hive is built into a valley pulled down from the forest with short cliffs to the ocean to the north and west.  It is an open air dwelling that was mostly created naturally.  The actual hive has been created from the paths of the dragonflies as they wander creating head height walls as the paths wore through time.  There are pocket areas where the dragonflies nest which are packed with mud, twigs, hair (from MonsterX), feathers, etc.
