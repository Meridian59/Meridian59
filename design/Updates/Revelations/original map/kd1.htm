<P>
Much like the Mad Scientist, the Bone Priestess has little connection left with reality.  She has made her home in a clearing in the jungle on the protected far side of the great chasm.  Skulls, hides and various artifacts from creatures surround her, stuck on poles, spread across the ground, and arranged in a fashion that she believes will give her power.  There are several fires burning and the entire area feels like the eerie home to ritual magic.  Her goal is to attain all the magic that she has seen the humans use on the island around her and she believes that these trophies of conquered creatures will help her attain that goal.
