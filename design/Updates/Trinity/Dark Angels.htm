<h1>Original backstory for Dark Angels</h1>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">by Chris Sellers<br>
<br>
</span>The Dark Angels ... those poor monsters.&nbsp; They were people
once.&nbsp; The wings are actually a parasitic demon: a pair of wings
with four huge talons in the center.&nbsp; The Wings fly around and
attack a person whose own sadness and depression have led him off by
himself alone.&nbsp; The Wings then prey on him, grabbing him around
the torso with the claws.&nbsp; If the person can't fend off the Wings,
he turns irrevocably into a stone statue animated only by the spirit of
the Wings.&nbsp; The pole-torch weapon of the Dark Angel is black iron,
if I remember right: it is the Angel's bitter strength.&nbsp; I don't
know what it's fashioned out of -- probably whatever metal the person
was carrying at the time.<br>
<br>
The Angel's stone features are erased by the wind, leaving it faceless.
Pieces of it break off as it carelessly maneuvers through the land,
half-paralyzed.&nbsp; It bothers to animate only the parts of its body
that it needs for killing -- like the arms, to wield the pole-torch.<br>
<br>
The Angel is a merciless, marauding killer ... if I remember right, it
would attack alone; hopefully it still does. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Wings themselves can't be killed, and the person who the statue
used to be is gone forever.&nbsp; But the statue can be destroyed, at
which point it crumbles to pieces, leaving behind the pole-torch.&nbsp;
The weapon is a souvenir, but using it (it is fueled by bitterness and
rage) attracts the Wings.&nbsp; The pole-torch is extremely powerful in
the hands of the Dark Angel, and less so in the hands of anyone
else.&nbsp; Not that we ever made it into an object, I don't think.<br>
<br>
At the time of the statue's destruction, the Wings separate from the
rubble and fly off to roost in a lonely spot.&nbsp; The Wings will
venture out from there as often as necessary to capture another
person.&nbsp; Over time, once in a dread age, the Wings (if unoccupied
with an Angel) will find a forsaken spot, make a nest, and lay eggs (I
don't know how many, but a lot) in the secluded nest.&nbsp; The cluster
of eggs is called a brood.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The only time the Wings are vulnerable is in their own nest, sitting on
their eggs.&nbsp; If an adventurer goes to that lonely spot and
destroys the brood, without being captured by the Wings, then the Wings
will shudder and die from a secret and unspeakable grief.<br>
