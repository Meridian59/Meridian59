-----------------------------------------------

WARNING!  DO NOT INSTALL THIS SOFTWARE 
before the date specified at
http://meridian.3do.com/update/.

If you install this software before that 
date, you will not be able to play 
Meridian 59.

WARNING!  The install process will erase 
your old game map files.  You will need 
to revisit rooms in order to rebuild your 
map files.  This was an unfortunate side-
effect of the substantial improvements 
made to the game.

If you are installing this software in 
order to update an existing copy of 
Meridian 59, you need to do a complete 
install of this software.

-----------------------------------------------
3. New Player Setup
-----------------------------------------------

Meridian 59 is an autorun CD.  Meridian 59 
setup and installation will proceed 
automatically when then the CD is inserted 
under Windows 95.  If the autorun option 
has been disabled, you will need to run 
setup.exe in the Meridian 59 root 
directory on the CD.

In order to play Meridian you will need to 
have a 32 bit Winsock Internet connection 
with an ISP or online service provider.  
You will also need a Web browser to set up 
your Meridian account.  Go to 
http://meridian.3do.com/registration to 
create your account.

-----------------------------------------------
4. Audio Tracks
-----------------------------------------------

Audio tracks containing a fully scored 
version of the Meridian 59 soundtrack are 
included on your CD.  You can play this 
soundtrack on an audio CD deck or in your 
CD-ROM drive using the CD-player utility 
included with Windows 95.

When you insert the CD into your CD-ROM 
drive, it will attempt to install Meridian 
again.  You should click cancel to abort 
the install.  You can then use the Windows 
95 CD-player utility to play the audio 
tracks.

When playing audio tracks from the CD in 
an audio CD player or in your CD-ROM drive 
you should select track 2 and then hit 
play.  Track 1 contains the Meridian game 
data.

Playing track 1 on most CD devices will 
result in silence.  However, on some older 
CD players it may produce unpleasant 
sounds which can damage your speakers at 
high volume.  Do not play track 1 as an 
audio track.

If you wish to play this music instead of 
the MIDI score built into Meridian 59, you 
can select the "Music Off" option and play 
the CD instead.  The CD tracks will play 
in order (or in the custom order you 
designate) but will not be synchronized to 
your location or actions in the game.
