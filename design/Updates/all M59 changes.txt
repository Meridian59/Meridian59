This is a list of all changes made to the game since the NDS launch.  It should be appropriate for players to view as most of the details have been taken out.




----------

* Renamed Reflect to Deflect.
* Fixed the cure disease bug.  The spell was putting the enchantment back onto the player, but not penalizing the stat points.  So, when the enchantment expired, it replaced the stat points which were never removed.  This lead to the increase in stats.
* Fixed Armor of Gort spell to work like armor does now, reduces damage slightly based on spellpower.
* Changed cure disease.  Updated it so that it only altered the state of the disease and gave back lost points.  A bit simpler, and doesn't reset the duration of the disease.
* Fixed Sandstorm and Winds to actually ruin ranged weapon shots.
* Changed it so that when a player has a random node removed, it chooses the more common ones first.
* Limited mana to a max of 250 after casting the Nodeburst spell.
* Fixed Glow to properly add itself to random generated weapons.
* Changed some spells to new levels and schools.  Examples below.
* Changed reagens of some spells to be more appropriate.  Each reagent now has a "meaning" for each spell school.
* Changed the reagents for Create Food from herbs to elderberries.
* Changed it so that you can mend items affected by the shroud spell.
* Changed Gaze of the Basilisk so that it no longer turns you to an an outlaw for just casting it.
* Added a post-cast delay of 5 seconds on swap.
* Made Create Food less random.
* Increased base duration on Haste.
* Made duration on Killing Fields a bit more random, cheaper to cast, and have a higher possible bonus to damage.
* Changed Dement's reagents to island reagents to fit Riija, 1 rainbow fern and 1 web moss (was 2 entroot berries).
* Qor priestess now requires that the player have Riija in order to learn Swap.
* Swap now requires yrxl sap as a reagent.
* Lowered Kraanan requirement for Spiritual Hammer.
* Made Unholy and Holy Resolve island spells with solagh as a reagent.  Spells were moved from the mainland priestesses to the bone priestess on the island.
* Made Detect Good and Detect Evil more newbie appropriate.  Now available from appropriate mainland priestesses and costs 1 fairy wing for a reagent.
* Added a Short Sword Fighting proficiency.
* Changed Spiritual Hammer to be a bit more useful: longer duration and mainland reagents.
* Made spiritual hammers so they can't be damaged, swapped, shattered, or weakened.
* Made Hold's duration a bit more random.
* Changed Discordance so that it has a chance based on spellpower to remove each room enchantment (previously automatically removed every enchantment).  Will automatically remove 1 enchantment if there are 2 or more enchantments in the room.  Also added a casting time.
* Changed Create Weapon to provide a bit more consistency in which weapons it creates.  Can also create Axes.  Weapon hit points are now a function of spellpower.
* Changed Free Action to eliminate up to 75% of Hold's duration instead of up to 100%.  Can still resist the spell outright.
* Added the new direct damage touch-range attack spells: Shocking Fury, Explosive Frost, Blast of Fire, and Splash of Acid.
* Fixed the intro text on various spells.  
* Added third person lute overlay for players holding a lute.

* Eliminated mana cost for sending over guild channel.
* Reduced reagent cost of Discordance.
* Removed outlaw/murder status changes and faction loss from attacking an enemy guild that has also declared your guild as an enemy.

* Increased life gained from Vampiric Drain from 1/3 damage done to 1/2.
* New attack spells are now sold by Maleval.
* Made the hit and miss sounds for touch spells more like punch sounds instead of the previously annoying casting and fizzle sounds.
* Changed herald shields to give spellpower bonus to spells if they have the proper insignia.
* Modified armor and shield defense bonus and damage absorb values.
* Reduced leather armor's initial durability.

* Moved Mace Fighting down to 1st level.
* Added spell Elusion as 6th level Riija.  Allows players to teleport to various towns, self-cast only.
* Split purify into offensive and defensive versions of the spell.  The defensive version, which will remain  named "purify", removes "negative" personal enchantments (a percentage chance per enchantment, as detailed above).  The offensive version, which is named "purge", removes beneficial pesonal enchantments (again, a chance per enchantment as specified above).  Changes below assume that both spells start with original stats.
* Reduced Purify's level to 4 (was previously 5).  Also reduced mana cost to 10 mana (was previously 20).
* Changed Purge to be an offensive spell.  Increased Purge's reagent cost to 5 emeralds (was previously 2).  Reduced mana cost to 15 mana (was previously 20).

* Made it so that Blue Mushrooms are a bit more common and Purple Mushrooms are a bit less common.

* Added mainland reagents as conditional sale items to island merchants at high prices.
* Added variables to control the game economy and drop rates.
* Fixed Frisconar to sell Solagh if triggered.
* Changed Rescue to be more like it's former version.  The new version puts a delay after the casting of the spell.  After the delay, you are teleported to a safe spot.  The delay is reduced as spell power increases, and covers a range from 15 seconds at the high end to damn near instantaneous.
* Increased the overall protection that Magic Shield gives you.
* Changed Feign Death to give you defensive protection while active.
* Fixed Rescue to eliminate multiple simultaneous castings.
* Casting Feign Death now removes an existing Morph enchantment.  Casting Feign Death while Morph was active confused the combat system, which tried to get combat stats from the "dead body" illusion.  As an added bonus, if you cast feign death while morphed, you look like the corpse of whatever creature you were previously.
* Changed it so that you cannot cast any spells that have another person (or no person) as a target while carrying a token.
* Changed Mana Focus to give a variable amount of bonus damage based on spellpower.

* Added purger ("Psychochild") weapons attribute.
* Increased the effect that punisher weapons have against murderers and outlaws.
* Changed it so that when teachers give you feedback about spells, it includes the name of the spell.  Fixes the problem of someone saying "lightning" in front of the priestess of Faren and her interpreting it as "light" and responding, "Congratulations!  You are currently qualified to learn that!"  Instead, she will respond "Congratulations!  You are currently qualified to learn light."  Works for other responses dealing with learning spells.
* Added Jala necklace.  Allows people to use it as an instrument and not take up their hands.  Eventually want to make it so that the caster can keep Jala spells going while fighting.
* Rebalanced reagents on spells to be more uniform and understandable.  Reagents now have "meanings".  For example, in Faren red mushrooms are for heat and cold, blue mushrooms are for lightning, etc.
* Added firesand as a conditional sale item on Jogeur, the Barloque Apothecary.
* Reduced the amount of time quest engine considers a "recent" failure.

* Added text to disciples robes description stating which school they are dedicated to.
* Lowered reagent cost for Reveal.
* Raised resistance provided by rings of resistances.
* Rings must now be identified.  Excpetions are wedding rings and signet rings.
* Fixed reveal to work on all spell items (rings, scrolls, potions, etc).
* Added spectral mummies as a monster.  They're newbie type monsters, a bit below zombies in the hierarchy of monsters.  .
* Changed mummy treasure to be more appropriate for the new spectral mummies.  Includes most reagents and most starting weapon types.
* Added casting messages for the caster of Minor Heal, Hospice, and Major Heal when the target is not the caster.
* Changed it so that you advance faster at lower levels.
* Fixed a bug where all weapon attributes were adding a to-hit bonus to the weapon equal to at least the original to hit bonus.  This means that one attribute doubled the base chance to-hit, two attributess tripled, it, etc.
* Tightened up the duration on Silence.
* Increased Discordance's chance to remove Anti-Magic Aura.
* Raised Anti-Magic Aura's level to 6 Kraanan (was 5).

* Changed it so that Intellect gives a bonus to improve abilities.
* Doubled unsafe logoff penalties for people that have attacked another player recently.

The winner gest 60% of the positive amount lost by the losing guild.

* Changed Rescue so that if you're guilded with a guild hall, you'll teleport to your guild hall if it's in the same region you are now.  If not, you'll go to the default location for the region.  If you cast rescue in your guild hall, you'll go to the default location in the region.
