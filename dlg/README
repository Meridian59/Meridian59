# NPC Dialog Management

These files manage random and triggered NPC dialog, primarily managed through `.tab` files and converted into admin commands using `dialogconvert.py`.

## Setting Up Dialog

After recreating the world (e.g., `send o 0 recreate all`) or during initial startup:

1. Move `dialog.txt` to the server run directory
2. Execute the admin command `read dialog.txt` to load NPC dialog into the speech library.

## Adding New Dialog

To avoid duplicates, new dialog should be adding using iterative `.tab` files:

1. Create a new `.tab` file with the desired dialog.
2. Convert it to admin commands with `python dialogconvert.py newfile.tab newdialog.txt`
3. Loading the dialog using `read newdialog.txt` in Blakserv.

## Updating Existing Dialog

When updating existing dialog, re-reading the same .tab file will create duplicates. Ensure updates are managed carefully to avoid this.

## Archives

Archived dialog files contain content from past events no longer active in the game.
