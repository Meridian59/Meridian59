Tosinnkeeper		murder	`kPaddock says, "Well, I certainly think it is strange that the Meridian Council had been meeting quite frequently at night the week before the poor Duke's bloody demise."
Tosinnkeeper		Murder	`kPaddock says, "I overheard a guard say that he went with a small band of guards into the forest looking for Miriana.  He said that when they found her, they tried to give her a message from the Duke, but that she grew angry and left.  Did she hate the Duke?"
Tosinnkeeper		Murder	`kPaddock says, "Huh, what did Tova do?   Tell him bad jokes till he croaked."
TosApothecary		Murder	`kFrisconar says, "Only the blind would not notice how the Princess was conspicuously absent the night of the murder.  Can we trust her stories?"
TosApothecary		Murder	`kFrisconar says, "Well, I'm sure I don't know anything about that.  I was visiting my mother; she's not well you know.  But if you think about it, it seems like the necromancers have been awfully quiet lately, maybe too quiet."
TosApothecary		Murder	`kFrisconar says, "You know I wouldn't put it past that simpering fop, Parrin, he's had his eyes on Duke Kalior for a long time now."
TosApothecary		Murder	`kFrisconar says, "You know some say that the Duke was actually poisoned, now Joguer he is an expert in those matters dealing with fatal substances."
TosApothecary		Murder	`kFrisonar says, "Maleval certainly seems to like young Akardius.  He seems almost protective.  I suppose it's only natural after what happened to Kalior."
TosBanker		Murder	`kSkivlat says, "It is unfortunate, but I'm sure that the driving force behind the Duke's unfortunate end is related to taxes.  Perhaps someone was tired of paying the high taxes, or perhaps another party wanted the tax money for themselves?"
TosBanker		Murder	`kSkivlat says, "Hey, doesn't Jonas give very generously to the Temple of Kraanan the Fist?  I wonder if his personal wealth is in trouble."
BarloqueBlacksmith		Murder	`kFehr'loi Qan says, "Isn't there a professional assassin who lives in the sewers of Barloque? He seems like a pretty clear suspect.  I'm surprised he hasn't already been arrested!"
BarloqueBlacksmith		Murder	`kFehr'loi Qan says, "Eh, who, murder you say, Screaming did it?"
BarloqueBlacksmith		Murder	`kFehr'loi Qan says, "Eh, what did you say?  Beggars poisoned the flute?"
Guildcreator		Murder	`kFrular says, "Madelia's such a sweet woman, maybe someone thought that they were protecting her."
BarloqueMerchant		Murder	`kHerbutte says, "You know what they say: look toward the one who prospered the most."
BarloqueMerchant		Murder	`kHerbutte says, "Did you ever wonder just what happened in those 'private' concerts Parrin used to hold for the Duke?"
BarloqueMerchant		Murder	`kHerbutte says, "I bet Madelia had one of her 'friends' do it for her."
BarloqueApothecary		Murder	`kJoguer says, "A friend says he saw a shadowy figure moving quickly through the Twisted Woods on the night of the murder.  He called out a greeting and it looked up at him with glowing red eyes, then disappeared."
BarloqueApothecary		Murder	`kJoguer says, "From what I've heard the Duke wasn't killed with a weapon or by magic.  It was poison.  Isn't poison the way the royals have always killed members of their own family?"
BarloqueBartender		Murder	`kMeidei says, "Well, travellers have told me that they see Miriana dancing in the woods with a knife.  Where did she get a weapon?"
BarloqueBartender		Murder	`kMeidei says, "Someone told me that they saw Roq the day after the Duke's murder carrying only one blade.  Doesn't he usually have two?"
BarloqueBartender		Murder	`kMeidei says, "Parrin seems fairly harmless to me, that is if he doesn't sing."
BarloqueBartender		Murder	`kMeidei says, "They say that the Duke was killed by magic, the school of Faren has many offensive spells, and who knows them better than the Faren Priestess."
BarloqueBartender		Murder	`kMeidei says, "You know I see Madelia down in the sewers every once in awhile, can't figure why she would be down there unless she was visiting someone."
BarloqueBartender		Murder	`kMeidei says, "Tova does have quite a mean streak in him, you wouldn't know it from his horrendous jokes but he does."
BarloqueInnKeeper		Murder	`kPrichett says, "Madelia told me that she went on a picnic with Akardius and that afterward he got very upset and ran off, crying, "Oh how could I have done this to poor Princess Kateriina?"   Could they be in love?  The Old Duke certainly wouldn't have approved of that!"
BarloqueInnKeeper		Murder	`kPrichett says, "I have it from a very authoritative source that Kalior was beaten to death, but I don't believe it for a second.  I'm certain Maleval did it and a beating just isn't his style."
BarloqueInnKeeper		Murder	`kPrichett says, "I've heard people say that Roq must have killed the Duke, just because he's an assassin.  I think that's silly.  And anyway, Roq couldn't have done it because I bought a dagger from him around the time of the murder.  That is, a friend told me he bought one.  A small one."
BarloqueInnKeeper		Murder	`kPrichett says, "Joguer had much correspondence with Roq, who do you think scrounged up a lot of those strange chemicals for his experiments."
BarloqueTailor		Murder	`kMadelia says, "A friend of a friend told me that Miriana was in the forest one day, and for no reason, she cried out, 'I did it, my lady.  He is dead.' I wonder if she meant the Duke?"
BarloqueTailor		Murder	`kMadelia says, "Well, there have been a lot of rumors flying around about Maleval or the Princess or you name it.  Some fool probably even suspects me.  But I wouldn't be surprised if the Duke had some secret lover; looks like a crime of passion to me."
BarloqueTailor		Murder	`kMadelia says, "I wouldn't think little Yevitan capable of doing something like that, but you never can tell."
BarloqueTailor		Murder	`kMadelia says, "Well, don't tell anyone I said this but, it seems to me like it was a crime of jealous passion and I've seen Parrin loose his temper before.  It's not pretty."
CornothInnkeeper		Murder	`kD'Franco says, "I thought I heard that Jonas was blaming Rook for the murder.  Isn't it funny that he would try to get Rook in trouble, especially when you consider their history together?"
CornothInnkeeper		Murder	`kD'Franco says, "I heard from a traveling merchant that there were all sorts of flashing lights and strange noises coming from the mountains over Brax on the night the Duke died."
CornothInnkeeper		Murder	`kD'Franco says, "I heard that Duke Kalior and Yevitan went to school together."
CornothInnkeeper		Murder	`kD'Franco says, "Tova was still pretty bitter about Paddock getting Familiars in Tos, cause he wanted that space as well."
CornothSergeant		Murder	`kRook says, "I've heard mutterings around Barloque about sending troops into the sewers to 'clean them out', but it sounds like a witch hunt to me.  Everyone knows Roq retired years ago."
CornothSergeant		Murder	`kRook says, "I'd be paying close attention to Parrin's song's if I were you, if he starts singing about murder it might well be a confession."
CornothSergeant		Murder	`kRook says, "It wouldn't be the first death under suspicious causes Quintor was linked too."
CornothSergeant		Murder	`kRook says, "There was a sickly green slime found on the murder weapon, smelled so bad one of the guards almost keeled over from the stench."
CornothSergeant		Murder	`kRook says, "Tova certainly does have the strength to drive a blade deep into a body."
Cornothgrocer		Murder	`kSolomon says, "I've heard someone say to a friend of mine that Jonas can't wield a real weapon to save his life, and that those war stories he tells are all a lie."
Cornothgrocer		Murder	`kSolomon says, "You'd never know it but that Yevitan is a real trouble maker."
Cornothtailor		Murder	`kHester Gilk says, "A friend of mine who works for the Princess says that she was convinced that the Duke had become a Necromancer."
MarionBlacksmith		Murder	`kColhorr says, "I've seen Tova and Jonas conversing quietly in the corner a few times, never could hear what they were saying though, and soon as I'd walk in they'd break apart."
MarionBlacksmith		Murder	`kColhorr says, "I find it strange that you can never seem to find Jonas when you want to.  He seems like the slippery type that could make a quick getaway."
MarionInnkeeper		Murder	`kMorrigan says, "I don't know if I should tell you this or not, but a friend of mine works as a guard for the Duke and he says that there is a big cover up going on.  Seems the Duke wasn't murdered at all!  He killed himself trying to take off an Amulet of the Three!"
MarionInnkeeper		Murder	`kMorrigan says, "A friend says she heard the Duke scream exactly four times.  Does that mean he was stabbed multiply?"
MarionInnkeeper		Murder	`kMorrigan says, "Well a horse is a horse unless of course you know what a horse is.  Sounds like one of Tova's jokes eh?"
MarionBartender		Murder	`kTova says, "Ran er'Hoth said the other day that the murder was done with a spoon.  Didn't Jonas say that he defended himself with a spoon one time when he was attacked in an inn?"
MarionBartender		Murder	`kTova says, "I overheard a conversation where one person told another that they heard Miriana running through the woods screaming something about Faren and wanting her weapon back.  What could that mean?"
MarionBartender		Murder	`kTova says, "They say that Duke Akardius was an accomplished swordsman.  Not that he'd have to be all that tough to get the jump on his uncle.  I mean after all he was a bit, um... big boned."
MarionBartender		Murder	`kTova says, "My cousin's wife's brother is certain that Maleval was at the Qor temple the night of the Duke's murder... um... I mean, not that she would ever go there.  Nobody in my family follows Qor.  Certainly not!"
MarionBartender		Murder	`kTova says, "I bet the Duke just killed himself, I mean wouldn't you if you had to listen to enough of Parrin's songs?"
MarionElder		Murder	`kRan er'Hoth says, "I heard Quintor caused that rockslide that killed poor Dookie Kalior."
MarionHealer		Murder	`kLady Afytn says, "I've heard people claim that Miriana is behind the murder of the Duke.  I find the idea of a little girl being behind a murder like that to be laughable."
MarionHealer		Murder	`kLady Afytn says, "Anyone who saw the look on that poor boy's face when he saw his uncle's body would know that he certainly couldn't have been responsible."
JasperElder		Murder	`kAfiera D'Xor says, "That boy, Quintor, he's certainly got the temper for it.  He always did get real quiet when anyone mentioned Duke Kalior."
JasperBlacksmith		Murder	`kQuintor says, "You know I think I remembering seeing Yevitan lurking in the sewers one day a few weeks back, wonder what he was doing down there."
JasperBlacksmith		Murder	`kQuintor says, "Logically speaking, it seems the easiest way to kill someone would be to hire an assassin.  That shifts blame away from you.  But then I've never planned a murder, so how would I know?"
JasperInnkeeper		Murder	`kWidow Qesino says, "I've always thought that behind that débutante exterior of Madelia's lurked a criminal mind."
JasperBanker		Murder	`kYevitan says, "Well you know Quintor killed poor Qesino."
JasperBanker		Murder	`kYevitan says, "They say ole Duke Kalior was a pale green color when they found him, sounds like poison to me."
JasperBanker		Murder	`kYevitan says, "Oh, I doubt that the person that killed the Duke did the deed alone.  I am sure anyone, even the Princess, could have hired some shady character to murder in cold blood."
JasperMerchant		Murder	`kZhieu B'hob says, "Well I don't think Quintor would do such a thing, unless he thought Duke Kalior was moving in on the Widow Quesino."
OneCouncilor		Murder	`kAlkhazar says, "Isn't it strange that the Duke was murdered so violently, but no one saw or heard anything?  Perhaps there was some strange magic at work that night."
OneCouncilor		Murder	`kAlkhazar says, "There have been whispers about the dark wizard Maleval...  I think people are just frightened of him because he's so mysterious."
OneCouncilor		Murder	`kAlkhazar says, "I heard someone say that they stopped by the Faren Temple on the night of the murder and Tenuv'vyal wasn't there."
TwoCouncilor		Murder	`kBei Naq says, "I've heard that Jonas never cleans his sword in public like he sometimes did before the Duke's murder.  What is he trying to hide?"
TwoCouncilor		Murder	`kBei Naq says, "Ever since the little 'incident' Yevitan has had it in for Duke Kalior, you know he fancies himself the next King."
ThreeCouncilor		Murder	`kCylill says, "Well I certainly wouldn't know, although I would think you'd need pretty powerful magic for a job like that."
FourCouncilor		Murder	`kDrechx says, "Some people say that it must have been the lich queen who killed the Duke, but we all know that she hasn't left Brax in millennia."
FourCouncilor		Murder	`kDrechx says, "Duke Kalior's been killed?  Huh, who did it?"
FourCouncilor		Murder	`kDrechx says, "People say that the intense feelings of dislike the Duke had for the poor Princess might have played a role in that dark night.  I doubt that this is the case.  While such feelings can drive one to rash actions, I don't think the young Princess struck out at him."
FiveCouncilor		Murder	`kEsseldi says, "I don't know anything about a weapon, but I do know that the feast hall was locked, no way in or out.  So whoever killed him must have had some way of teleporting out of there.  The only people I know of with magic like that are the necromancers."
KraananPriestess		Murder	`kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "`b`IThere is more to Duke Akardius then meets the eye;  ever wonder where he's been all these years?  The Island, studying at the Temple of Riija, that's where!  I tell you, anyone who has spent that much time with the God of Trickery isn't to be trusted.`n`k"
KraananPriestess		Murder	`kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "`I`bYou know Priestess Tenuv'vyal has always been a little on the strange side, but lately she has just been slipping further and further away, I wonder why."
QorPriestess		Murder	`kPriestess Zuxana says, "`BThere are some that would say Priestess Tenuv'vyal stood against all the Duke Kalior did.`B"
Minstrel		Murder	`kParrin Aragone says, "`IYou know I wouldn't be surprised if it was a crime of passion and Madelia was the center with Duke Kalior the victim.`n`k"
Minstrel		Murder	`kParrin Aragone sings, "`IPoison, poison, icky sticky poison.  Who would have thought the dukie would fall to nasty, smelly poison.`n`k"
JealousGeneral		Murder	`kJonas D'Accor says, "hmm... well the first thing that comes to mind is that Maleval certainly had free access to the Duke.  Don't know how Kalior could stand him.  He gives me the creeps."
JealousGeneral		Murder	`kJonas D'Accor says, "There is the one obsidian blade that I see Quintor toying with from time to time, but he gets real nervous about it if anyone notices."
Izzio		Murder	`kIzzio says, "I don't know anything about what happened that night at the Duke's Keep.  I was in the forest, trying to find mushrooms while avoiding that Miriana."
Izzio		Murder	`kIzzio says, "Ah, the power of nature can be a most destructive and deadly force."
Kocatanbonepriestess		Murder	`kThe Bone Priestess says, "`BCHITTY-UP!! Murder?  TIC-TIC-TIC-TIC!!! WIK WYAAK nyuk KAW-KAW ukuk, KWEEEK KRIPP TEC-TEC CHREIIP ik QUAWK ak nyuk uk uk KAW-KAW!!!`B"
KocatanMadScientist		Murder	`kThe Mad Scientist says, "Ah yes, now murder, well that's quite an interesting topic you know. You look tired, here sit on this chair.  Want something to drink and I'll tell you more information?"
KocatanMadScientist		Interesting topic	`kThe Mad Scientist says, "`B`rSee there are so many different ways to actually commit the crime, you could SMASH someone to death with oh say a chair, or then there's the elegant approach, a vial of posion poured in your drink while you aren't looking, and don't forget that you could just BEAT THEM to DEATH, or or one could always slit your throat while you were sleeping, and I guess you could just hire someone to do it, but that really takes all the sport out of it don't you think...`n`k"
