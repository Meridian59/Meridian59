ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "Legend has it that the gods martyred themselves out in the Holy Land of Trolls when the Nexus collapsed hundreds of years ago."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Those councilors are trying to reopen the ancient Nexus with the tokens. I'm not so sure that's a good idea. Who knows what will happen when those tokens are brought together? They ought to be ready to call the attention of the gods when that happens."
