OneCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	node attack	~kAlzahakar says, "We must work to rid ourselves of this irritating nuisance, Miriana, for she seeks to disrupt our hard won balance by draining the nodes."
OneCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	node attack	~kAlzahakar says, "Destroying Miriana and her foul creatures is our only hope of preventing a disaster which we could not counter easily."
OneCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	miriana	~kAlzahakar says, "She is born of pure chaos and is nothing more than a tool for destruction, the only good that can come from this shall be from her demise."
OneCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	miriana	~kAlzahakar says, "The child wishes to create chaos by trying to turn each other against ourselves."
OneCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	miriana	~kAlzahakar says, "Do not stand here wasting time, while that menace runs amuck across the land!"
OneCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	Node attack	~kAlzahakar says, "I can imagine for one such as yourself in power that the loss of even one node would be a tremendous loss."
OneCouncilor		madelia	~kAlzahakar says, "Obviously she is in league with Miriana, or the creature has some hold over Madelia. Her words are pure madness."
OneCouncilor		fates	~kAlzahakar says, "The time for myths and legends passed us long ago."
TwoCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	node attack	~kBei Naq says, "Stealing power, stealing money, what's the difference? This Miriana is a thief, plain and simple, and the only way to deal with thieves is expedience."
TwoCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	node attack	~kBei Naq says, "This cannot be tolerated any longer, this thieving wench must be stopped, no matter what the cost."
TwoCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	miriana	~kBei Naq says, "All those years of living in the forest all alone have demented the child. Her mind is obviously been warped by her loneliness."
TwoCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	miriana	~kBei Naq says, "Yes, yes, I'm sure she says there are good reason behind what she has done, but can you truly trust one as destructive and chaotic as her?"
TwoCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	miriana	~kBei Naq says, "She is a rabid animal that needs to be put down before she infects anyone else."
TwoCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	Node attack	~kBei Naq says, "Just what is your interest, or stake, in these attacks?"
TwoCouncilor		madelia	~kBei Naq says, "A foolish girl trying to grasp a hold of any attention she might be able to conjure."
TwoCouncilor		fates	~kBei Naq says, "What about the date?"
ThreeCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	node attack	~kCylill says, "From a strategic standpoint I must admit that her tactics are sound, if not desperate, but with sufficient force and planning Miriana shall be decimated."
ThreeCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	node attack	~kCylill says, "First we must defend the nodes in a military manner, only by doing such shall we have a chance to destroy her. We cannot think as mere civilians any longer. Now what defensive position are you skilled enough to assume?"
ThreeCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	miriana	~kCylill says, "I must admit is a refreshing to have an opponent again, and one as unpredictable as her, but never fear her demise shall be soon in coming."
ThreeCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	miriana	~kCylill says, "By creating rumors of treacherous behavior and greed she then accomplishes her goal of chaos and infighting. We mustn't let her weave her deceptions any longer."
ThreeCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	miriana	~kCylill says, "A quick strategic strike is in order here, get in, do the job, get out. That is all that is needed, and then this menace shall be quieted forever."
ThreeCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	Node attack	~kCylill says, "I'm not sure what exactly Miriana hopes to accomplish, I mean there is more power stored within the tok..within the land itself than in the nodes."
ThreeCouncilor		madelia	~kCylill says, "Well she did have a meeting with Alzahakar awhile ago, but that was to discuss the Princess's birthday, and her coming of age."
ThreeCouncilor		fates	~kCylill says, "Bah, what use are legends when you could be hunting for the perfect weapon to guide your arm."
FourCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	node attack	~kDrechx says, "You must come to your own decisions on what that means to you as a person and as a member of your political faction."
FourCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	node attack	~kDrechx says, "Think of the land as your body and the nodes as your blood.  How would ~Iyou~I feel if someone was trying to drain all of your blood dry."
FourCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	miriana	~kDrechx says, "Quite the little 'firestarter' isn't she. Well her fun and games will shortly be brought to an end."
FourCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	miriana	~kDrechx says, "I guess it will be a race to see who destroys her first for her impudence, us or Lord Faren."
FourCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	miriana	~kDrechx says, "Insolent brat, she will receive her just dues in good time."
FourCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	Node attack	~kDrechx says, "If you wish to keep your body healthy and in good form you must help us be rid of Miriana and her creatures of destruction."
FourCouncilor		madelia	~kDrechx says, "Tsk, tsk, tsk she doesn't lead a healthy life, and with these tales she so readily spreads her life looks to become much less healthy."
FourCouncilor		fates	~kDrechx says, "Have you been delving into the children's stories again?"
FiveCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	node attack	~kEsseldi says, "You know this reminds me of the time I was exploring the Icky caves, in search of the node there, and a group of orcs and spiders banned together to try and take me down.  Were it not for a few brave souls who came to my rescue then all would have been lost."
FiveCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	node attack	~kEsseldi says, "Its incorrigible, doesn't anyone realize just how precious our nodes are? They must be protected at all costs. Well what are you doing just standing there? Go, go and protect the nodes!"
FiveCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_GOOD	miriana	~kEsseldi says, "If only she could have been shown the error of her ways, but now I fear it is too late and our only path is her destruction."
FiveCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	miriana	~kEsseldi says, "These 'accusations' that she throws towards us are only to shift attention away from herself and her chaotic actions, pay no heed to what she says."
FiveCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_BAD	miriana	~kEsseldi says, "Freak! Deviant!!"
FiveCouncilor	LIBRES_MOOD_NEUTRAL	Node attack	~kEsseldi says, "I have taken it upon myself to study the nodes, and the effects of the attacks, and from what I can see is the nodes themselves are regenerating their power again after each attack. It is quite amazing I assure you, but I cannot be too certain that the nodes can sustain many more attacks."
FiveCouncilor		madelia	~kEsseldi says, "Oh yes the young lady with such and interest in the ancients 'Gods', 'tis a pity that Alzahakar couldn't help her."
FiveCouncilor		fates	~kEsseldi says, "Just a myth tossed about to give people something to talk about."
