CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kSolomon says, "Did you know that Jasper was once a separate kingdom, and stayed in rebellion long after the King in Meridian declared that they must surrender? That will tell you something about Jasper. A very terrible war followed. The fortress of the old Jasper Warlords, Wryn’s Keep, stands to this day as testament. The people of Jasper, I believe, still want their independence to this time! There are many secrets in Jasper, even today. Especially today."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jasper	~kSolomon says, "Although the mines in Jasper have run dry and the miners moved away, there are still a considerable number of gems that come out of the western Cragged Mountains, and Jasper in particular.

So generous and kind, Lady Aftyn, that she no has opened a Sanctuary in Marion where she cares for the sick and the unfortunate! And with her own money! Yes, Tabu, her children are most upset by her actions since the death of her husband, a very wealth Lord that I knew so very well, may the gods smile at his soul... The children are still in Barloque, such scandal, making many noises about their mother squandering their inheritance on her charitable work and on the workings of Shal'ille! Goodness me, Tabu, goodness me."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD	madelia	~kSolomon says, "Yes, she is a very desirable sort, a terrible heartbreaker! Poor jhonee!! She scorned Frisconar, and rightfully so, for he is dumma, unhealthy. Now I hear she has a great love affair with Frular the Guildmaster! But noble one, you did not hear that from me, for he is a married man! Oh dear, such scandal! Baszoo!!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL	madelia	~kSolomon says, "She is in Barloque, and what an accomplished dressmaker. She makes all of the clothing for the royalty, and it is said that she has great influence!! Yes, great influence!! It is just as well that she spurned the love of that dinki padarapoomy Frisconar!"

CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kSolomon says, "Marion is so very stable, and the people so funny in their ways!! But the forests surrounding Marion are deep, and hold many secrets! I have seen some incredible things that have been brought out of these forests.

CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL	marion	~kSolomon says, "A simple town of simple folk. Farmers! The very stones of the earth! An honest town, my friend. We must all thank the farmer and the farm!!"

CornothGrocer	MOOD_NOT_BAD	morrigan	~kSolomon says, "That ghazzabu does not know a dragon scale from an orc tooth! Ha, ha ha ha ha!! One of my customers sold him three dozen edible mushrooms at great profit, for Morrigan thought that he was buying purple mushrooms!! Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"

CornothGrocer	MOOD_BAD	rook	~kSolomon says, "What do you ask me of Rook for, silly siidhika? Don't get any ideas, you don't need to challenge Rook to impress us! We are already impressed with your dim wits, dinki padarapoomy. Baszoo."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD	rook	~kSolomon says, "Ah yes, Rook indeed! The sad tale of Rook is a sad tale of impossible love! We cannot know if it is a love of duty or of the woman herself, but his love for the Princess came to complicate his duty to her as the Major of the Royal Guards, and he was forced to leave the court! Dueling for her honor! Tragic, eh? Now he spends his days taking students at the weapon school and waiting for a message from her that it is time to return to her side. Just waiting and waiting, for a message that may never arrive. But he is a hard man and will wait until he dies. Baszoo."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL	rook	~kSolomon says, "Rook, yes Rook? Ahhh, Rook! Yes Rook is a great weapon master, who once served as the Major of the Royal Guards before retiring to this fine city and opening the weapon school. He is a stern man, but he is understanding, and we in Cor Noth are honored to have him here. They say that in his years at court he was a fierce duelist when his temper flared, but he is not this way anymore. Baszoo."

CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kSolomon says, "Tos is the financial center of Meridian. Many business people are loathe to say that aloud, but I will tell you that it is true."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL	tos	~kSolomon says, "The memory of Kalior shall forever stay with Tos. It was he who made it the grand city that it is. I wonder if it shall all fall into decay?"

CornothGrocer	MOOD_BAD		~kSolomon says, "Perhaps you would be able to better get along with those that you have dealings with, siidhika, if you would pay closer attention to what the other party wants! Every transaction, every conversation has two sides, but how would I expect a wagzidi herak to understand that!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_BAD		~kSolomon says, "Ah, prattlemouth! How you remind me of the fool of Tos, Rycksher. Always talk . Gossip and talking, and the business of everyone else. Ha, ha  ha ha!! Well you won't get any gossip in my shop!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_BAD		~kSolomon says, "What is that stench? Oh, it's you, my friend!

Oh, siidhika bagab, I am so sorry but you are repulsive, like fried liver and stink grass! Ha, ha ha ha ha!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_BAD		~kSolomon says, "Be careful siidhika, that you do not drop some of your fleas on my carpeting and tapestry work, I will have to get a Kraanan mender in to de-louse the shop. Ha, ha ha ha ha!! No offense, ghazzabu, but indeed you are a pathetic specimen, ha, ha ha ha ha! What can I do for you? I am afraid that I do not sell soap or ghum dikka!!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_BAD		~kSolomon says, "Do you continue to befoul my modest and humble shop, beetle stain? Ah, that is truly the trouble with leaving the door open, siidhika, one never knows what offending debris may waft in with the next breeze! Ha, ha ha ha ha!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_BAD		~kSolomon says, "Ah, be sure to scrape off your feet before coming in to my shop next time, dung boy! This is a shop where nice people wish to pass time, not the barnyard you frequent, billy goat! Haga dhami zeet, sidhika."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD		~kSolomon says, "I have a few small apartments upstairs, which will occasionally come up for rent. There are no vacancies now, but check with me later if you are interested."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD		~kSolomon says, "You have definitely come to the right place for your magical reagent requirements!! Although I may not carry everything that you need, but what I have is the best quality! Just between the two of us, I feel quite sorry for those customers of mine that must do business with Joguer."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD		~kSolomon says, "Oh, that Rook! What a sad friend that I have in that man Rook. He hides from his lost love as though it were a forgotten love, yes? Oh yes, he is in love, but his love is for the Princess and may never be realized. Ah, so tragic and so complicated!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD		~kSolomon says, "And what has happened to the merchant Qesino of Jasper? Yes, an innkeeper from Jasper, perhaps you knew him for he was a prosperous man. Generous? No! Prosperous? Yes! But now he has gone missing, and with a large amount of ~Igold~I."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD		~kSolomon says, "Bung dabba!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD		~kSolomon says, "Think of my shop as though it were your own, noble one. As your own."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD		~kSolomon says, "Relax, and enjoy my hospitality, my dear friend. Although it is modest I offer you every comfort that I possess."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD		~kSolomon says, "Look around, Tabu, take all of my time that you wish to take. When you are in my shop you may leave time and trouble together at the door, where they may be occupied with each other while you are my guest."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_GOOD		~kSolomon says, "Providence has truly blessed me today with your presence, Tabu. I am blessed every way."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "I have heard from travelers of an ancient building out in the forest that was a dwarven hall. This makes me very curious."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "If you are traveling from city to town, I believe you will find that people may have errands for you to deliver to their remote destinations! Oh, the countryside is hardly safe for an unarmed messenger!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "It is a strange and bountiful land, noble one. Many of the exotic items that you come across in your wanderings will have a market when you reach the towns, so preserve what you can. There are some items that I am always looking for, and will draw a fine price in gold."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "Many of the things in my shop must come across the southern passes in the Cragged Mountains. It is a perilous journey, Tabu, for these passes are the home of the most fearsome trolls. And for the past few years now I hear reports of orcs and mutated ants there as well. It's no wonder our import prices rise!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "Cor Noth is the center of trade and other activities of culture in this land, noble one. You must take the time to enjoy this fine city while you are here. I am certain you will find it to your liking!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "I have an extensive collection of magical reagents here, many of them quite rare. I offer the best prices for quality goods as well, my friend, so see me before you go to Tos, Barloque or Marion. We can reach an agreement, jhonee tabu, because we are old friends."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "My friends come from every part of this world to visit me and enjoy the hospitality, Tabu. I am blessed by their presence, by the generosity of the gods, and by the many, many stories of my guests!! Oh, I hear stories from every part of the kingdom."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "Yes, and have you been to see the madman in Marion? Ah Tabu, what ravings! What diwesafi! What kagdur! Many years ago he walked the land and I knew him then, and I believe that he is a prophet. Yes, truly!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "My dear friend Herbutte has a very fine shop in Barloque. And what a gentleman he is, of the most regal bearing!! And his shop also is full of beautiful things, perhaps if I do not have what you need he will. Be sure to tell him that I sent you!!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "Yes, beautiful things. Exotic, beautiful things."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "I am sure, noble one, that I must have something here that you have been living without for much too long."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "What happiness that you are here today, Tabu. I have just received merchandise that I am sure you will appreciate."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "It is my tremendous fortune to have you here to visit, Tabu. May I show you anything in particular? Or have you come today to sell?"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "Please, you are my guest. Be comfortable and enjoy the modest jewel that is my shop."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "Binghi ghaloob, my friend, binghi ghaloob."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "How happy I am to see you, noble one."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kSolomon says, "I am your humble servant, Tabu, honored to count you among my friends. Please be kind enough to pass the time with me."
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kSolomon says, "It is my understanding that the uncut seraphym, found around Konima's Island, can be worked by a jeweler into a polished state. And how beautiful it is then, Tabu. And for the jewelers, it is but a hobby!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kSolomon says, "Only flawless reagents are useful for the casting of spells, Tabu. There are some orc teeth, plus the more rare dragonfly eyes and kriipa claws that simply are inferior!"
CornothGrocer	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kSolomon says, "Everyone is talking about this new school of magic, the Riija school. From what I can understand, Tabu, it is characterized by extreme power at high cost, but that ultimately it is quite frail. Flawed, overall."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	avar	~kD'Franco says, "Go on, you. That's enough with your prying."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	avar	~kD'Franco says, "Probably get a whole feather bed out of just one of those beasts, if what I hear is true. I think we don't have the luxury of time on this one, we march an army right through that human settlement and take the whole damned island with one move. Simple like, just like that."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	avar	~kD'Franco says, "I say hit them before they hit us, and hit them hard."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	barloque	~kD'Franco says, "Is that where you hail from, stranger? What a joke. It's a cesspool of corruption and royal dogma."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	barloque	~kD'Franco says, "A complete waste of space. A blemish on the face of this land. The entire city ought to be ~Iburned~I to the ground, and its inhabitants sent off into the wilderness to fend for themselves. Snobs and thieves, the lot of them."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	barloque	~kD'Franco says, "A nice place, I guess. If you like all the trappings of the royalty, or if you need the sort of artificial solace that a royal family provides. I don't need it, and I wouldn't live there. Not on a bet."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	bye	~kD'Franco says, "Good riddance. Humpf."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	bye	~kD'Franco says, "Come back and see us soon, %NAME!"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	bye	~kD'Franco says, "Goodbye. Be careful now."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	cor NOTH	~kD'Franco says, "Mind your own business, you. Don't go disturbing honest folk in here with your sniveling."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	cor NOTH	~kD'Franco says, "Cor Noth is a great town, loyal and patriotic to this kingdom. I think it has become a bit ~Itoo~I tolerant, if you know what I mean. An awful lot of foreigners here, most of them suspicious."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	cor NOTH	~kD'Franco says, "I love this town. Great place. I served in her forces, and would put my life forward to defend her without hesitation."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	council	~kD'Franco says, "Don't you go sticking your nose into my business, stranger. I don't know you from Konima."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	council	~kD'Franco says, "Not a bad bunch of guys, if you enjoy conversation with impotent old men. Myself, I've got no time for it."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	council	~kD'Franco says, "You're full of questions, aren't you? Well, the Council is kind of a hold-over from the days when the King still ruled from Barloque. It's mostly a ceremonial position now, a kind of honorary entitlement."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kD'Franco says, "I salute Kalior, even in death!"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kD'Franco says, "An honorable man."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kD'Franco says, "Akardius had better do something with the army. Kalior spent the better part of his years making it the best in the land."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD	grassy knoll	~kD'Franco says, "There were three shooters."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	hello	~kD'Franco says, "Humpf."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	hello	~kD'Franco says, "Hail, %NAME! Come in and make yourself comfortable."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kD'Franco says, "Hello! Welcome to the Cibilo Creek Inn."
CorNothInnKeeper		Izzio	~kD'Franco says, "Yea, I've seen him. That sorry excuse for a peddler has been in here. I hope he is not polluting the King's way with his presence again. That man needs to get a real job and stop forcing his wares on the weary travelers coming into town."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	jasper	~kD'Franco says, "What are you doing snooping around my inn? Be on your way, you."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kD'Franco says, "Traitors! The people of Jasper are traitors! Duke Akardius will take care of them, in good time... "
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jasper	~kD'Franco says, "Stay away from Jasper, if you want my advice. That is a dangerous, deceptive place."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	king	~kD'Franco ignores you.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	king	~kD'Franco says, "Kill Zarcos, and people I know will reward you beyond your wildest fantasies."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	king	~kD'Franco pretends you didn't say anything.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	marion	~kD'Franco says, "I don't like the looks of you, not the least little bit."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kD'Franco says, "Watch your back in Marion. Royalists, you know."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	marion	~kD'Franco says, "Marion's a great town, if you like sitting around and watching the corn grow."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	money	~kD'Franco says, "Forget it. I don't loan money out."
CorNothInnKeeper		need a courier?	~kD'Franco says, "Not right now, %NAME. Perhaps later."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	orc	~kD'Franco says, "What do you know about fighting orcs? Mind your own business."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	orc	~kD'Franco says, "We should flood the warrens."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	orc	~kD'Franco says, "Those awful beasts should be exterminated. We tried, some years back, and I lost a lot of friends in the campaign. Slowed them down for a while, checked their advance but you can bet they'll be back in all their force and fury."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kD'Franco says, "Who are you poking around other peoples business like some kind of a Royal spy? Get out of here, you. I've got nothing to say to you."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kD'Franco says, "Hang the rich."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kD'Franco says, "She should stand trial for her family's crimes against this country... that is, if she purports to be the representative of the Zarcos family. And if she isn't, why then she should get out of the palace and make an honest living like the rest of us."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kD'Franco says, "Princess Kateriina Zarcos? I don't abide by her right to succession, or with the manner that her family has run this land into the ground over the last up-teen generations. That's right, ~Igenerations~I."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD	princess	~kD'Franco says, "You've got to be kidding if you call that pathetic wench the heir to any throne."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	Tangee Bluff	~kD'Franco says, "I'm not talking to you about that."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	Tangee Bluff	~kD'Franco says, "I don't know what happened... it was... hey, so I kind of lost it, okay? So I didn't know what to do, I couldn't make sense of anything, I panicked, okay? But you just don't know what you'll do at a moment like that until you're there, you know that? Do you know that?"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	Tangee Bluff	~kD'Franco says, "We were marching all day in the sun, climbing a rocky trail about two days south of Jasper. It was hot, and we hadn't seen a thing since we set out. Gotta give the orcs that, if they don't want you to see them then you won't see them. But they hit us just before sundown, in from both sides. Squeezed the scouts out, isolated them and slaughtered them to the man. They came in three waves, and by the end of an hour they were gone. We lost half the battalion, all Cor Noth men, about two hundred and twenty. We turned around that night, and dragged the wounded home back through the pass."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	tos	~kD'Franco says, "Don't you have anything better to do than disturb an honest businessman with your prattle? You annoy me."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kD'Franco says, "Tos is truly the capital of Meridian, and those that say differently can hang. I consider it to be the center of government, the seat of real power."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	tos	~kD'Franco says, "Cor Noth may be the best place to come for interesting conversation and ideas, but Tos is the business center of Meridian. I try to get over there as often as possible."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD	tova	~kD'Franco says, "Tova is an idiot."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	troll	~kD'Franco says, "Take your questions somewhere else."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD	troll	~kD'Franco says, "They are demons, warbeast slaves to the orcs when their armies march because of some ancient malevolent pact. I have seen it with my own eyes, in the battle at Tangee Bluff."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco pointedly yawns.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco absently picks his nose.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco wipes his brow and scowls.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco just looks at you, shaking his head.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco doesn't let you out of his sight.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco wipes his hands on his shirt and scowls at you.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco mumbles to himself distractedly.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco eyes you and spits.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco clears his throat noisily.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco says, "Humpf. I think you should be going."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco bangs dishes around as he cleans up, clearly annoyed.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco sneers at you.
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kD'Franco says, "You're a liberal, aren't you!?!"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "Two words, and two words only. Civil war. Think about that."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "Descendants of Konima or not, I say we jump on those militaristic people on the island with both feet. Wipe them out, and now. Or should we just wait around for them to do the same to us?"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "The Royals are building support, secret-like. I'm not so young that I don't remember what it's like under a corrupt King's rule, and no way am I going back to that. They'll have to bury me first."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "The King lives yet, although he is in hiding. I don't where he is or when he'll resurface, but you can bet he will. Crazy? Crazy like a fox, that old man."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "I hear that there's a ~Isubstantial~I bounty for the loyal citizen who finds the old fox King Zarcos. That's not public knowledge now. I also suspect that if someone were to find him and he met with some kind of accident, that person would make some ~Iinfluential~I friends indeed."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "The Princess is a ~Itraitor~I. Akardius needs to pull the troops together, as this land is in a state of emergency. Orc Warrens! Armies of bird-beast men! We need strong leadership, and as for the Princess? Throw her to the dogs!"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "After we take care of the orcs and the avar and the so-called human settlement at Ko'catan, something needs to be done about Jasper. They are a rebellious people, prone to violence and insubordination. Their history shows that quite clearly."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "That Yevitan up in Jasper is a man to watch. Scheming and clever, I know he's up to ~Isomething~I."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "The time when we needed a Royal Family for anything in this land is ~Iover~I. It's just sentimental nonsense. Nostalgia and schlock. Bah!"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "I haven't been over to Konima's Island, and I'll tell you the truth I don't think I want to go. But I've seen some of the goods from those ~Ipeople~I and I'm here to say that their workmanship doesn't hold up to what we have here in Meridian."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "Always great to see you."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "Far'Nohl was a great man that turned to evil. He ruled this kingdom many years ago before his treachery met with an evil demise. But now his restless spirit wanders the earth again. He is evil incarnate."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kD'Franco says, "I have heard from a traveler that there is a dictator that rules those island people. She claims to have seen him... she says that he is old and decrepit, but a direct descendant of Konima himself!"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Oh dear! Who shall raise the army to stop the orcs? We know where they are; but is there a force that can stop them?"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "You know, with all the changes in the land, the new faction, Jonas leading the rebels, these attacks on the nodes, one starts to wonder just what lies ahead for us."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "I pray that Kalior's military does not disintegrate in his absence. It will take a strong leader to fill those boots. Who is going to stop this civil unrest?"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "I lament at the fall of Kalior. He may have been the only one capable of stopping the threats imposed upon this land. Hail Kalior! May his memory live forever!"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "These island people, the so-called followers of Konima... who is to say that they're our allies? What do we really know about them? They are an unknown element, and we need to treat them accordingly. Keep them at an arm's length."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "These tokens that the Meridian Council carries are mysterious items indeed. I have even heard that those that carry such a token are immune to the effects of death!"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "To improve your abilities as a warrior, go and talk to Rook. His house is here in Cor Noth, right up the street. He is one of the finest swordsmen that ever lived, and is certainly the finest teaching his craft today. Even if his allegiances are... suspect, at best."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "To regain your strength from your journeys and from fighting, an inn is the best place to rest. You're safe here, and we'll see to all of your needs."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "When you're just beginning the path of the warrior, stick to fighting creatures that are not ~Itoo~I powerful. I started with giant rats and baby spiders before I went into the army and really learned the business of fighting."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Often the townspeople in Meridian need errands run for them, or favors. If you can help them out it is a good way to receive a reward of one type or another. We've all got to make a living."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Many of the townsfolk in these parts have spent some time adventuring themselves, and have ~Ispecial~I knowledge themselves that you may profit from. The trick is in getting on the right side of them to learn their minds."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "There is now a fifth temple where the dedicated may go to study in their school of magic, from my understanding. That is the Riija temple, thought for many, many years to be lost and now rumored to be on a remote and mysterious island."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "I don't know about you, but I'm getting fed up with all this superfluous magic use in the towns. Some spellcaster makes it dark, and then it's too light from someone else's trickery, maces and apples lying all over the place... I won't stand for it in my place, and you can bet the Duke is looking into it. It's harassment, plain and simple."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "When business was good, everybody was happy. Duke Kalior kept the wheels turning and the money changing hands. He was and still is a great man."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Brigands and thieves running all over the land... what next? Someone has to keep those murdering, thieving swine in check. Thank Faren for the courage of those who do."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "I have heard that at the heart of these orc warrens is a huge amount of treasure, should any party of adventurers be valiant and persistent enough to make it there."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Not all opinions are of equal value. Some opinions are better than other opinions. Since this is my establishment, my opinion is the best opinion available."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Check out the news globe there in the corner, there are some interesting posts."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "The Bards are a great addition to this town. Always helpful, full of information."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "These red sky days are a curious event. I stay inside the inn here when they occur, where it's safe."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Some strange reports coming from the mysterious island. They say there is a race of bird-like men there with a deadly magic all their own."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "I served with Duke Kalior's Army when the call to duty came. Cor Noth Light Infantry, Third Battalion under General D'Accor. I was at Tangee Bluff, no doubt you've heard of the battle there."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Anyone can speak their mind freely in my inn. You are free to express yourself here, provided you use good manners."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "I could tell you stories about the Third Orc Campaign that would make your hair stand on end... but I don't like to talk about it. I saw too much, I tell you, too much."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "I am proud to be from Cor Noth. Fourth generation, and my family has a long record of service and patriotism."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Business keeps this country up and on its feet."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Money. You may not like it, but you have got to have some."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "All are welcome at the Cibilo Creek Inn, and all may speak their minds freely. We only ask that you keep a civil tongue for the benefit of our other patrons."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Come in and make yourself comfortable. What is the news from outside these walls?"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Can I get you anything?"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "What?"
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Ouch."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Must have been something I ate."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "Darned heartburn is acting up."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco belches loudly and says, "Excuse me."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kD'Franco says, "An innkeeper couldn't ask for a better town to set up shop in than Cor Noth. Between the university here, and all the travelers passing through, this place is always busy. Cor Noth is the crossroads of Meridian, no doubt about it."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kD'Franco says, "It's nice to be alive, here and now."
CorNothInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kD'Franco says, "Nice to have you here."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	avar	~kRook says, "They are very dangerous, from the tales I have heard. I understand that the Avar can field armies, as we can! I do not think that you will ever see such a force in these parts, though."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	barloque	~kRook says, "Thou art unfit to bespeak the name at all, knave. Go on, be about your business."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	barloque	~kRook says, "I wish I'd never left, curse the day that I first set foot in this dry place, but the choice was not mine to make, don't you see. In time we must all obey our masters. And as importantly, those that advise our masters."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	barloque	~kRook says, "'Tis not a fairer place in the world than the royal Barloque. By my life there is not."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	bye	~kRook watches you leave, very carefully.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	bye	~kRook says, "Fare well to you, my friend."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	bye	~kRook says, "Good day."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	cave orc	~kRook says, "I have not yet encountered a Cave Orc, though you can be sure that they are as formidable as their mountainous counterparts to the south of here."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	cor noth	~kRook says, "Go out and see it, knave."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	cor noth	~kRook says, "Cor Noth is in a strong position strategically, in a flanking position for any attack on Barloque that might come from Tos, or the mountains beyond. It is no accident that I have chosen this place for my ~Itemporary~I exile."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	cor noth	~kRook says, "It is a fair, provincial town. Suitable enough for my academy, though I must say it is dominated by bookworms and squidheads."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	council	~kRook says, "Flee, fool. Scatter."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	council	~kRook says, "Old men. What position is there for a lame panel of toothless half-wits in our current situation? Take them for a long walk, and come back alone, I'd be happier for it."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	council	~kRook says, "Once respected, certainly, but my view is that it is time that they move to a strictly advisory role are replaced with younger, more aggressive thinking citizens."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	cylill	~kRook says, "An honorable officer, and a veteran with an impeccable career. He is on the wrong side though, serving with the Duke's Army, and I fear that we may someday meet across the field from one another."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	dragonfly	~kRook says, "Most remarkable, if what one hears is true! You will not encounter Dragonfly on the Meridian mainland, however. They are confined to Konima's Island."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kRook says, "What a waste. All these years competing for the throne. Why couldn't he have died years ago and made Kateriina's rightful ascension to the throne easier?"
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kRook says, "I guess I have lost the chance to kill the pig myself."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kRook says, "This Akardius makes the hairs on the back of my neck rise. Someone ought to watch him."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	hello	~kRook watches you, slowly running his fingertips back and forth across his upper lip.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	hello	~kRook says, "Come in. It is a pleasure to see you again."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kRook says, "Good day, %SIRMADAM."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	jasper	~kRook says, "I have no time for this talk."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kRook says, "A thorn in the side of this kingdom since the beginning of time, the people of Jasper have launched more campaigns against the throne than all the orc hoards combined."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jasper	~kRook says, "A rebellious place, and a tough people, natural irregulars. Fine soldiers."
CorNothSergeant		jonas	~kRook snorts contemptuously, "Humph, what next?  King Jonas?  HAH!  That blubbering buffoon couldn’t lead an army of brain dead trolls, let alone his own faction."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	jonas d'accor	~kRook says, "He has been a little more tight-lipped. I've also heard he has been wandering a bit more frequently.... Wonder what he's up to."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	king zarcos	~kRook says, "Even now his forces gather, in anticipation of coming battle."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	kriipa	~kRook says, "I have not yet seen this monster, for they live far off in the jungles on Konima's Island."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	lupogg king	~kRook says, "There is but one way to attack the Lupogg King, and that is with numbers. Send in different leads to engage him, and pull those warriors back when they become wounded."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	marion	~kRook says, "Bah."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kRook says, "The Royalists have many loyal allies in Marion. The rank and file of every King's Army throughout every war in this lands' history has marched from Marion under the banner of the Zarcos family. The people of Marion stand by the King even now."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	marion	~kRook says, "A fine town. Ever loyal, ever valiant, ever strong."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	medei	~kRook says, "An utter fool."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	morrigan	~kRook says, "A loyal ally to the King."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	orc pitboss	~kRook says, "Only the mightiest warrior should pit their skills against the Orc Pitboss in solo combat, for he is incomprehensibly fast and stronger than two men."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	orc chieftain	~kRook says, "Only the mightiest warrior should pit their skills against the Orc Pitboss in solo combat, for he is incomprehensibly fast and stronger than two men."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	orc wizard	~kRook says, "The Orc Wizard is found in the caves and underground passages of the Orc Warrens. They possess powerful magic, but I cannot say their strength."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kRook says, "Thou hast not the honor to speak such a noble name without besmirching it by proxy. Leave mine sight, patch, ere I run you through the guts and leave you to die like the dog you are."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kRook says, "To this maiden I have pledged mine life, and now await the chance to hold my strength to the test. I know that she had to send me away, just as I know that the time will come when she shall require my loyal service again. I await that time, and practice my skills."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kRook says, "How now! What news of this fair lady do you bring?"
CorNothSergeant		rebels	~kRook says, "Do I think they are a threat?  Don’t make me laugh, I mean their headquarters is located in a bar."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	regifan du bukise	~kRook says, "In truth this Regifan is not a threat to man or beast, he is a rodent with ideas. I have but little use for academics, intellectuals, and the like, for I have heard enough of their theories on why this land suffers."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	rugby	~kRook says, "I played when I was younger, of course... stand-off, in the academy and for Barloque. I cannot play any more, however, as those hooligans from Marion fractured my spine in a dirty tackle."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	Shadowbeast	~kRook says, "I have heard that the shadowbeast has the ability to darken the area around itself. I have never seen such a beast, but I know it to be a formidable opponent."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	teach	~kRook says, "I take students on a as necessary basis."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD	tos	~kRook says, "Moron. Go and bother someone else, or I'll have one of my understudies dispatch you."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kRook says, "A den of iniquity. We will live to see Tos burned to the ground, sieged and put to the sword. You have my word as a gentleman on that."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	tos	~kRook says, "The business center of Meridian. Need I say more? Naturally I don't have much occasion to travel there."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	ultima	~kRook says, "Ha ha ha ha ha! What's this? Where? Ultra what?"
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook says, "Leave me."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook says, "I haven't time for you. Leave this place."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook says, "Our conversation is over. Leave me now."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook mumbles, "Impudent upstart, power is so important to him now that he is determined to take others down with him."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook pointedly ignores you.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook says, "Get thee gone. I am weary from the burden of your company, and my patience grows thin."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook says, "I have no more time to waste with your like. Be gone."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook says, "Thou dost not want to anger me, be certain of that. Go, before you err beyond mine temper, knave."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook says, "Go back to your Duke and tell him to keep his servants about his own house, where they won't get hurt. If you stay here I cannot promise your safety, slave. Get thee along to thy mommy."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook's eyes become narrow slits, as he watches you with calculated venom.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook nods his head slowly, watching you move about the room.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_BAD		~kRook is fuming mad.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD		~kRook says, "King Zarcos lives, but is in hiding somewhere in Barloque. The time is right for him to return."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD		~kRook says, "I live by the code of honor and that of the blade. There is no question that cannot be resolved within these sacred laws."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_GOOD		~kRook is so clearly a little man with an over-active ego.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "'Tis a swordsman that thou fancies thyself? Mayhap I could show thee some guidance in your discipline, if thou art practiced enough and ready to progress."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Dost thou work then with the battle axe, to master its finer points? I too have dedicated my life to the combative skills and their perfection, and now earn my fortunes by teaching what I can. When thou art ready to learn more skills, perhaps I will help thee for a price."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "If thou art following the path of the archer, then thou hast come to the wrong place, for I know nothing of that weapon except that those that fight by bow do so without honor. If thou art following the path of the archer, then get thee gone to the company of rogues and ambushers, for that is who would use such a weapon."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Dost thou use the mace as thy weapon of preference? 'Tis an honorable weapon, and deadly in the hands of one versed in its mastery."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Of the traditional weapons, I would take the long sword above all others. It is the mainstay of the King's Army, and as such I have spent the best of my life dedicated to the perfection of its art."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "The ways of magic are the ways of priests, the weak, the blind. Forsooth the ways of magic are the ways of those without the mettle to fight with honor, and distinction."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "For the enterprising traveler, there are often messages that must be carried back and forth between parties across the land. Thou will'st certainly gain favor and often profit by playing the envoy."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "The short sword is an honorable weapon, the weapon of the ancient gladiators of Tos. It is no match for the long sword in its reach, but it is deadly close-in."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "There will be trouble soon between the factions. Fighting trouble."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "If you wish to improve your skills as a warrior, you must fight against opponents that are worthy, nay, even beyond your abilities."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "You will not advance your abilities if you are not willing to take risks. If you want to grow stronger, you must face great danger, and be willing to take wounds."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Kateriina needs to take the throne now. All things point to it. She is of age, Kalior is no more, and that fledgling politician, Akardius, is not fit to rule."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Thou hast come seeking the finest master swordsman to ever grace this land, and thou stands now before him. What dost thou humbly ask?"
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "There are some warriors that seek solace in the mighty Kraanan. They have developed spells, potions and wands in his powerful name... I feel certain that Kraanan himself is angered at these weaklings, and at their inability to wield a blade. A warrior hasn't time to pray in battle."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "On what side dost thou stand, friend? Barloque or Tos? If thou com'st from the Duke's camp, why then state thy business and we shall see to it now. But if thou dost side with the Princess, why then thou art most welcome, and consider my house as your own."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "If a man is not afraid to die, then it is of no avail to threaten him."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "The ultimate honor for a warrior is to pick the time and the place of his own death."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Training, training, training. That is the way behind the greatest warriors, every one."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "The shield is a useful tool, and if thou will fight with one, choose yours carefully."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "The great yetis of the ice caves to the west are a challenge even to fighters of the most developed ability."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "The orcs are powerful swordsmen, though certainly lacking in the subtly that come with study. But do not underestimate them. You may end up paying for that mistake with your life."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Yes, I am the greatest swordsman who has ever lived. The greatest."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Pick your battles carefully. You will retain your enemies forever, for the most powerful of them will never forgive, or forget."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "You must never back down from ~Iany~I fight, against ~Iany~I foe. Never concede, nor surrender an inch of ground. Even if you are killed, it will be with your pride."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Keep your wits sharp, and your strategy two steps before the strategy of your foe. Strategy and skill will prevail over even the most powerful enemy who fights with skill alone."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "You stand before a master. Bow."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "Gather together the ten most gifted sword fighters of the land, and send them at me in a single wave.  I will deliver to thee ten bodies, ten headless peasants, and would be without a scratch."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook is a man with a legendary temper, with the reputation as the greatest duelist of the age.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook has the mannerisms of a well-groomed military officer, although beneath his impeccable manners lies the temper of a gut-shot troll.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook says, "What can I do for you today?"
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook taps a little rhythmic patter out with his fingers against the back of his left hand.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook eyes you coolly. 
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook stands very, very straight and watches your every movement.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRook is possessed with a sense of grace and agility that is evident immediately to any in his presence.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kStanding before this little man it isn't hard to see that his reputation as the deadliest swordsman alive is believable. His every move is careful, smooth.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "The orc scimitar is a ungainly weapon, heavy and off balance. Certainly not the weapon for a officer, though it is quite fearsome in the hands of those practiced in the skill. There are those around that would be able to teach a warrior those skills. Not myself, mind you."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "Look straight into the eyes of your enemy, as your battle approaches and when battle is engaged. Do not shift your gaze to their hands, their sword, or any distraction that they might encourage. The battle will be won or lost through their eyes."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "The swordsman rules the day. Or swordswoman, for many of the finest warriors in this land are female, as I should know, for they all pass through these doors seeking the advice of the ~Imaster~I."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "I am to understand that there is a great teacher on the faraway land at Ko'catan who teaches the bow. A fantastic weapon for the hunting, but forsooth I cannot say that a warrior would use it with honor in the field of battle."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "If thou might wish to dedicate thyself to the scimitar, then I have heard that there is a man in Jasper that might be persuaded to help thee with that. I have heard that there is a teacher there who has great skills at the orc weapon."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "The future of this land is as a map is, where the mileposts will instead be swords. It is a map where the piled corpses of the enemies of the crown will lie as thick road lines to mark the passage of the valiant forces of the Princess Kateriina."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "I am loyal to none save the crown and to the lineage of the Zarcos line, a family of most royal bearing. Their direct bloodline has ruled this fair land for two centuries and half another, a bloodline that now sustains in the rightful heiress Kateriina. No others will ever challenge this right by sword as long as I stand."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "I have killed twenty-four men in duels alone. Do you think you live by honor? By chivalry? It is up to you how you want to live, and how you die. If you live with dignity and honor then death is of no consequence."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook seems easily offended.
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "Thy karma is much more profoundly effected when thou dost kill another person as to when thou dost kill a beast."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "A large foe like the Lupogg King should only be attacked in sufficient numbers to deal many blows, or thou is doomed indeed."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRook says, "Keep this in mind: that when one is attacked with magic, the power of thine weapons and thine armor will protect thee if thy gear be strong enough."
CorNothSergeant	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kRook says, "If thou will dedicate thyself with equal ardor to the combative arts as thou dedicates thyself to meaningless prattle, you will surely be a giant."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD	barloque	~kHester Gilk says, "I don't have occasion to travel, ah, to Barloque with frequency."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD	barloque	~kHester Gilk says, "Barloque is a, ah, a sort of a shell of a city, almost a perfect metaphor for the state of governmental affairs here in Meridian. Nothing left but the trappings of royalty. Some, ah, some pieces of decaying grandeur. So what."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL	barloque	~kHester Gilk says, "The sea is very beautiful at Barloque. I think the city itself is a bit, ah, a bit dry."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD	bye	~kHester Gilk watches you briefly, and then goes back to her sewing.
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD	bye	~kHester Gilk says, "Good bye. Be careful."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL	bye	~kHester Gilk says, "Ah yes, goodbye."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD	cor NOTH	~kHester Gilk says, "Well, I haven't been here long enough to form a strong opinion one way or the other."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD	cor NOTH	~kHester Gilk says, "Cor Noth is the city of my exile. Of all the cities in Meridian, I believe that Cor Noth is the most palatable, but it is not the home that I have left behind. I have much work to do here."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL	cor NOTH	~kHester Gilk says, "Yes, this is, ah, this is a lovely place, my new home. It has been very welcoming toward me. You could say that I am grateful."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NOT_BAD	council	~kHester Gilk says, "The Council? I understand that they are, ah, very wise and venerable men."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kHester Gilk says, "Which one? The dead or the living?"
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kHester Gilk says, "D'Franco is surely abashed at the death of Duke Kalior."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kHester Gilk says, "It appears that even without Kalior, his plans to earn the throne may still throw Meridian into civil war."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD	hello	~kHester Gilk nods without looking up from her sewing.
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD	hello	~kHester Gilk says, "Hello. Is there something I can show you?"
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kHester Gilk says, "Yes, hello."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD	jasper	~kHester Gilk says, "I don't know anything about this place."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kHester Gilk says, "You could say that I have an, ah, an affinity for Jasper, and the people of Jasper. Like me, the people of Jasper have borne the abuses of power on their spirits, and on, ah, on their independence. You might also say that I am involved with their struggle, and with their future."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jasper	~kHester Gilk says, "I have many recent friends in Jasper. The people there have many troubles to overcome, many hurdles."
CorNothTailor		marion	~kHester Gilk says, "I understand that it is a quaint city, although I must admit that I have not yet visited the town. I am looking forward to that time."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kHester Gilk says, "I think I have heard something about her."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kHester Gilk says, "She is a fool, and, ah, and must step down in the face of progress. I fear, though, that she will continue to resist our evolution toward progress. Don't we have the right to self-determination? Yes, we do. There is no room for sentimentality or nostalgia in the present. Life is pressing."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kHester Gilk says, "Yes, the Princess Kateriina. A fascinating woman, I understand. Yes, the people seem most fond of her."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NOT_BAD	solomon	~kHester Gilk says, "I trust Solomon implicitly. He has been, ah, a good friend."
CorNothTailor		tos	~kHester Gilk says, "When I first arrived in Meridian, of course I went to Tos. But I couldn't settle there, I will say that it is far too busy for me. Cor Noth is much more to my liking."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NOT_BAD	yevitan	~kHester Gilk says, "Yevitan is a very interesting man, ah, he has certainly survived a great deal. He an enemy to be respected, or a powerful ally to his friends. "
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD		~kHester Gilk says, "There is more. It is said that Joguer has been making regular trips to Tos, where each time he makes huge deposits in the bank. Yes, ah, very large sums. And this is told to me directly from a person who has heard it from Skivlat, the banker. That makes it as good as true."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD		~kHester Gilk says, "Caramo has much more influence over the office of the Justicar than you might imagine. In fact, she not only counts the votes, but is responsible for implementing the Justicar's decisions. That is, ah, however she interprets them to be."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD		~kHester Gilk says, "There has been quite a bit of talk about Frisconar lately. Have you heard? It seems that he has been connected with the recent rise in the dubious activities of the Necromancers! Fantastic! What do you suppose his motives would be, ah, if it were true, that is."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD		~kHester Gilk says, "Have you heard any new news of the affair between Herbutte and the Princess?"
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD		~kHester Gilk says, "I have heard that Frular and Rook are going into, ah, business together. I have heard that they are raising an army, with Frular's funds and, ah, Rook's expertise."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD		~kHester Gilk says, "Word is out that Madelia has become the Princesses closest confident. Who knows what effect this will have on court politics?"
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD		~kHester Gilk says, "The rumors continue that Akardius and Alkahazar keep the deal made with Kalior, and are now conspiring together for the throne. They are surely a force if this is true."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD		~kYou get the feeling that Hester Gilk is pointedly ignoring you.
CorNothTailor	MOOD_BAD		~kThere is something about this shop that makes you decidedly ~Iuncomfortable~I.
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD		~kHester Gilk says, "There are, ah, people that will help those in need and, ah, that have the resources to afford such help. People that I am connected with, that I trust regardless of their motives."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD		~kHester Gilk says, "Be especially careful in Tos. They have two dukes, one dead, one alive, both equally dangerous."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD		~kHester Gilk says, "The Royalists too have their means... spies, soldiers, secrets. Beware the princess followers, and be not taken in by her charm."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD		~kHester Gilk says, "Most of the business leaders in this land are in collaboration, attempting to establish an ideological stronghold to defend their interests. Do not believe whatever information you may receive to the contrary, for there is also an enormous amount of misinformation."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD		~kHester Gilk says, "You must be very careful what you say to others about your political views in Meridian, especially in Tos. You never know where that information will, ah, will end up."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD		~kHester Gilk says, "For a price, you can receive any sort of help that you might need, help with ~Iany~I circumstances."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD		~kHester Gilk says, "Please take all the time that you need to look, ah, look around the shop. We shall talk when you are done."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_GOOD		~kHester Gilk says, "We look out for each other. I keep, ah, an eye out for you, and you keep an eye out, ah, out for me."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "There seems to be quite a lot of, ah, excitement that has been stirred up between the factions of the Duke and the Princess. Seems to be very serious."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "We must stand up for each other, the common people."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "No one knows what is the origin of the famous tokens of the Councilors. That they are great sources of power, there can be no doubt, for I have heard that they are capable of teleporting themselves around!"
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "This land does not need a strong King to get it, ah, back onto its feet, it needs a strong Queen. The men in this land have had their chances to straighten things out, and have continually failed."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "I understand that there is a lot of trouble in Tos after dark, that it is not safe to be on the streets near the graveyard. No one has yet explained why the dead rise in that city and attack the citizens."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "I have heard something about an ancient Dwarven Hall somewhere out in the wild lands. What do you suppose that is?"
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "I have heard that a large black market is springing up around that new green mineral from the Island of the Illusionist."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "Can I help you find some thing in particular? I've got something here, ah, I've... "
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "Have you heard why the blacksmith Fehr'loi Qan moved his shop from Tos to Barloque? Do you suppose it has anything to do with the forces of the Princess and the Royals building up a large, ah, large stockpile of weapons and armor?"
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "You may judge for yourself the quality of my work, but if I may say so the clothing I have here is without parallel."
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk says, "Are you looking for a particular, ah, a particular style or color of garment?"
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk stitches adeptly at a silk blouse.
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk seems to follow your progress around the shop while she returns to work on her sewing.
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYou see that the excellent reputation that this shop has earned is well deserved. It is exceedingly well-organized, tidy, and comfortable.
CorNothTailor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kHester Gilk ties a neat knot at the end of a stitch and nips it off neatly with her teeth.
DarkWizard		Ancient one	~kMaleval says, "Why don't you ask the priestesses about them.  I would be interested to hear their response."
DarkWizard		ancient ones	~kMaleval says, "Please, do not demean your intellect by believing that the only powers in our world are those of some glorified heroes."
DarkWizard		Brax	~kMaleval says, "I remember the people of Brax as very industrious... perhaps too narrow in their vision... or perhaps merely very unlucky."

DarkWizard		Components	~kMaleval says, "Crafting a spell requires concentration, practice and special reagents."
DarkWizard		faren	~kMaleval says, "If there was no Faren would the winds cease to blow? The winds have been blowing for longer than people have believed in the thunder god."

DarkWizard		help	~kMaleval says, "I can help you better understand magic and how you learn it."
DarkWizard		Hunter	~kMaleval says, "They will be no match for the dark forces which they supposedly hunt.  Their undoing will be their swords."
DarkWizard		jala	~kMaleval says, "How is it that a god can die? Legend says by a dagger. Ha, what poppycock indeed."
DarkWizard		Kraanan	~kMaleval says, "Kraanan is merely an excuse to get drunk and fight and feel good about doing so."
DarkWizard		Lich	~kMaleval says, "The lich is the first incarnation of the Ancient One in this realm.  It is a child of darkness that will bring others to this land. It is a messenger of doom for this world.  The Ancient One has been awakened."
DarkWizard		Necro pendant	~kMaleval says, "A toy for children who wish to live forever and lose their soul.  A truly remarkable invention."
DarkWizard		Necromancer	~kMaleval says, "They are proof that things are not so neat as the priestesses would have you believe. Of course there are other forces of immense power in our world."
DarkWizard		qor	~kMaleval smiles, "There is no goddess of evil. Just evil people who cannot take ownership of their own guilt."
DarkWizard		Reagents	~kMaleval says, "Reagents are items the store a concentrated amount of energy that you can channel through a spell. Some are very difficult to acquire. Others can be found easily. Then there is Solagh."
DarkWizard		Riija	~kMaleval says, "Ah, the ultimate illusion. Riija does not exist! How simple it is to play tricks on the human mind."
DarkWizard		sell	~kMaleval says, "I am not a peddler, cretin."
DarkWizard		shal'ille	~kMaleval says, "If she is so powerful, then why does she let good people die?! Are you telling me a goddess does not have the power to protect her children?!"
DarkWizard		solagh	~kMaleval says, "Solagh. Ha. The apothecaries of the land are wise to guard their secret else they will lose the monopoly on this substance."
DarkWizard		sword of the hunt	~kMaleval says, "Please entertain the notion that the hunters and the necromancers serve the same function.  Their methods and ideologies may be separate, but make no mistake, they both eat souls."
DarkWizard		Urn	~kMaleval says, "The Ancient One, long ago, created instruments through which it could manipulate the environment.  This is done to prepare the way for its rebirth. The urn is one such instrument."
DarkWizard		Venya'cyr	~kMaleval says, "She was a child when she encountered one of the most powerful forces in the universe.  When the Ancient one opened his eyes and saw her, her soul became a toy."
DarkWizard		Zarrus	~kMaleval says, "You must give the man credit for escaping the destruction of his homeland.  He was a shameless survivor."
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kMaleval speaks an ancient three word incantation. The last word sounds something like "necktie."
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kMaleval bows to Zuxana, "My lady, I have information for you."
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kMaleval says to the priestess, "As you wish."
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kPriestess Zuxana says, "~I~rAh, Maleval, what news do you have for me?~I~k"
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kPriestess Zuxana says, "~I~rWe shall finish our discussion later, Maleval.~I~k"
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kMaleval and Priestess Zuxana begin to laugh together.
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kMaleval says to Priestess Zuxana, "I have ~Ispoken~I with the Duke."
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kPriestess Zuxana says to the dark wizard, "~I~rIs all going as I planned?~I~k"
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kMaleval grins, "Zuxana, the one that you spoke of before, is now dead."
DarkWizard	MOOD_BAD		~kSensing that you are listening, Maleval abruptly ends his conversation with the Priestess.
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kMaleval says, "My liege, I have done the research that you have requested. She is not in touch with the needs of her followers. It may be the key."
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kMaleval says, "I require reimbursement for my efforts, Akardius. Much of my time was lost doing your work."
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kMaleval says, "I have scried the counselors meeting, my liege. For the appropriate price, I can tell you their minds with regards to the Princess."
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kMaleval says, "My magic tells me of a new agent of the Bourgeois Castle. When you ascend to the throne, I wish not to be forgotten, my liege."
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kDuke Akardius says, "Good, Maleval. You will be paid as promised for your information"
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kDuke Akardius says, "Remember that we have renegotiated the price, Maleval, so you would do well to hold your tongue."
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kDuke Akardius says, "Maleval, I will remember your station when I become King. You will get what you deserve."
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kMaleval bows to Duke Akardius.
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kThe Duke nods to Maleval, "That will be all for now, wizard."
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kMaleval whispers something softly and the Duke grins.
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kMaleval says to the Duke, "Will there be anything else, my liege?"
DarkWizard	MOOD_GOOD		~kThe Duke says to Maleval, "You may leave."
DarkWizard	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kMaleval says, "I do not wish to be disturbed."
DarkWizard	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kMaleval says, "Justice is blind, would you not agree?"
DarkWizard	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kMaleval begins to make some guttural sounds. All of the dust near him vanishes.
DarkWizard	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kMaleval's ring glows for a moment. The dark wizard laughs to himself.
DarkWizard	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kMaleval says, "I grow hungry." He then waves his hand and smiles contently, "that's better."
DarkWizard	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kMaleval says, "That old wizard Alzahakar believes that the Tokens have great power.  Reunite the tokens.  Ha!  He and his followers are on a fools errand."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval practices bizarre incantations.
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "There is no power in religion. None whatsoever."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "Two sorcerers may employ the same spell, but it will be vastly different depending on their own skill."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "Spells do not come from the gods. They come from within. Anyone can employ the mystic arts if they have the inclination to learn the proper components."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "The wild girl Miriana is so young and innocent, yet her untamed mind speaks volumes of truth."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "There are times and places where magic grows stronger."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "The gods are merely a convenient way to describe that which cannot be explained by simple minds."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval grumbles, "I am in no mood to be trifled with."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval smiles, "I sense an awakening. Someone has learned a new spell."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "Which god do you believe in?"
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "You need to expand your horizons. However, expanding your horizon will mean limiting someone else's."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval waves his hands as if caressing a floating animal. You sense magic in the air.
DarkWizard			~kMaleval winks an eye at you. You feel as though he has looked into your very soul. He shakes his head and grunts.
DarkWizard			~kMaleval waves a hand and says some ancient word. The room suddenly smells better.
DarkWizard			~kMaleval begins coughing violently. He wiggles his fingers slightly and the coughing subsides.

DukeLiege		princess	~kDuke Akardius says, "A willful woman is the Princess. Fine royal blood courses through her delicate veins. She would make an excellent consort to a worthy King. Of course, if she were too unruly, I would toss her out on her ear. Let her find her way back to her threadbare temple."

DukeLiege	MOOD_BAD		~kDuke Akardius says, "Although I can see how the council could be so taken with the Princess, surely they shall come to realize her innocence in matters of politics and power."
DukeLiege	MOOD_BAD		~kDuke Akardius says sourly, "Kateriina appears to be busy beguiling the council at present. Quite interesting.
DukeLiege	MOOD_GOOD		~kDuke Akardius says, "All is well in this kingdom. The council quite reasonably accords me the respect due my station through their support of me."
DukeLiege	MOOD_GOOD		~kDuke Akardius says, "I assume you are aware of proper etiquette when presented before one such as a Duke."
DukeLiege	MOOD_GOOD		~kDuke Akardius says, "If you train well, I might consider you to Champion me so that we might best the Chieftain of the Orcs."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius says, "My subjects have often need of couriers.  Should you prove your worth to them, I may be inclined to pay you attention."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius sighs, "My dear uncle almost emptied the coffers to refurbish that stone creation of an Arena. And to think that there still aren't padded seats."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius says, "I'd like to build another castle on the island of Koc'atan someday.  Blackstone Keep is the second oldest castle in the land, and quite drafty."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius says, "Presently the council spends far too much time studying those tokens, but if that is what makes her...them happy then I shall lend whatever resources available to help them."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius says, "The Princess spends far too much time with her nose in those books, the space from her library could be put to much better use."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius says, "I trust you have indulged in the marvels of Tos. If not, then you must take in the sunset from the old graveyard; the view is...unforgettable."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius says, "My poor, dear uncle. Tis it not odd how he met his death under mysterious circumstances similar to King Zarcos IV?  Maybe the keep is cursed."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius says, "To this day, I do wonder if the spirit of Queen Katria revels in her most marvelous sacrifice of life for her daughters."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius says, "By my word the King is mad and must never again regain power!"

FiveCouncilor		tos	~kEsseldi says, "I don't much care for Tos as a town. Don't get me wrong, the architecture is amazing, like a piece of history sitting right there. But the people don't much respect the antiquity of the city and tend to abuse it. I only go through Tos when I need to advise the Duke."
FiveCouncilor		urn	~kEsseldi says, "I remember there was an urn in  the story of Venya'cyr but I do not remember what its significance is."
FiveCouncilor		Venya'cyr	~kEsseldi says, "Poor girl. She was trapped by the forces surrounding her.  Would you have done any different? Could you have done any different?  Can any of us say we have not succumbed to our darker instincts at some point? It just cost her more than it has the rest of us."
FiveCouncilor		Zarrus	~kEsseldi says, "This is probably not the most popular thing to say but, I think the man was a coward for leaving his city without standing to fight."
FiveCouncilor	MOOD_GOOD		~kEsseldi says, "Smell that fresh air!"
FiveCouncilor	MOOD_GOOD		~kEsseldi says, "What a beautiful day to be outside!"
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "I've been studying these tokens for a long time now. I think I'm starting to figure out why they keeping popping around on us. Just some theories really, but I'm making progress."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "If you're a clever explorer, you'll figure out the way to the inside of the stone circle in the land of Trolls."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "I tell you I have been almost everywhere it seems, except the underworld that is. Strange how there are so many ways to get out of the afterlife. A lot of open doors... "
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "I find that traveling around is the best way to learn about the world, but there are some people that can teach you a thing or two as well."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "All of the Gods have temples out here in the wilds. Problem is finding them. I still don't have a clue to where old Riija has hidden out. And I'm beginning to believe that whatever was left of Jala's temple is long gone, washed away by the servants of Qor."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "If you are hunting for the Mana Nodes, it's an awfully good idea to hire a mercenary to guide you. The paths are often treacherous. I'd guide you myself, but I'm off on my own quest now."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "I'm heading up towards the Seafarer's Peak myself. It's a wonderful view up there."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "The one place I hate exploring is those blasted sewers. They seem to go on forever. It would be interesting, but they just smell so bad."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "There's nothing like a good hike to clear your mind. As long as your careful about the animals that is."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi applies some balm to his feet.
FiveCouncilor			~kYou detect the pungent scent of skunk in the forest.
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "Watch out for trolls. You know I heard someone call them by some other name recently."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "Jonas D'Accor knows more than anybody about the old legends of Konima."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "History claims that the ancient Empire used to trade with us through the Nexus near Castle Victoria. The Nexus was destroyed centuries ago. Now only trolls guard the stones that once marked the gateway."
FourCouncilor		barloque	~kDrechx says, "The capital city of Barloque is afflicted with rats. Those rich fellows there ought to spend some shillings on mercenaries to rid her sewers of the vermin, before disease is spread."
FourCouncilor		brax 	~kDrechx says, "I am no historian.  Talk to the malnourished wizard Alzahakar if you want to know about such things.  Let me ask you this, Have you ever seen that man eat? I have not."
FourCouncilor		bye	~kDrechx says, "Good health to you, friend."
FourCouncilor		cor NOTH	~kDrechx says, "The scholars' town of Cor Noth suffers from a pollution problem. They best clean out their stream before it spawns more dreaded slime on the world."
FourCouncilor		cor NOTH	~kEsseldi says, "You like standing around in towns, Cor Noth's one of the nicer ones. They ask me to give lectures at the University from time to time. One day, I'll get around to it, I figure."
FourCouncilor		council	~kDrechx says, "King Zarcos was wise to abdicate the throne to us five councilors. His mind is afflicted with mental health problems that have been seen in a few of the Kings before him. He needed to remove himself from the pressures of rule in order to heal. The five of us will see to the Kingdom, until a successor is chosen."
FourCouncilor		duke	~kDrechx says, "This Akardius has his head on straight. If the people will it, my vote is his."
FourCouncilor		hello	~kDrechx says, "Greetings, my friend. How's your health today?"
FourCouncilor		hunter	~kDrechx says, "The hunters relationship with her sword seems unhealthy to me.  It is unnatural, and hence it is not good for the body."
FourCouncilor		jasper	~kDrechx says, "Since the intrusion of Jonas and the rebellion into their lives I must say that the citizen’s health is much improved.  Although I could not reccomend it as a usual treatment."
FourCouncilor		Ker'toth	~kDrechx says, "He was deformed, if I remember the story correctly.  The people did not like the fact that their leader was so hunched over and quiet.  The story said that the king lost his voice. How can you have a king with no voice?"
FourCouncilor		Lich	~kDrechx says, "From what I have heard, the lich can not die.  Her body is transformed by the powers that corrupted her.  I wonder what it is like to live forever?"
FourCouncilor		marion	~kDrechx says, "Marion is a town in perfect health. It balances the simple needs of the body with the temperament of peaceful living. It is small, but I guarantee that town will outlive the others."
FourCouncilor		necromancer amulet	~kDrechx says, "The Necromancers pervert all life with their very existence.  The pendant is the culmination of this perversion.  Do you know that the only thing a Necromancer can eat is the life force of the living.  Real food is like poison to it."
FourCouncilor		necromancer amulet	~kDrechx says, "This is how the Necromancers feed both themselves and their Queen.  It is truly vile.  I know only what Alzahakar tells me."
FourCouncilor		ohm	~kDrechx says, "Good, don't you feel more relaxed now?"
FourCouncilor		princess	~kDrechx says, "She has what it takes to rule the land, yet there is a naivete that prevents my full support."
FourCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kDrechx says, "Anything that makes the body dependant on foreign material is ultimately bad for the person.  I know these weapons seem to aid the Hunter immensely but I often wonder about the toll it takes on the body."
FourCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kDrechx says, "I hear that it is magical."
FourCouncilor		Tendrath	~kDrechx says, "Isn't he the new vault man in Tos?"
FourCouncilor		token	~kDrechx says, "The tokens have a warm life affirming glow coming from them. A soul, I'd say. That's why monsters scurry to gather them. It's the nature of life to attract other life. That's also why death doesn't seem to have such dire effects on us humans when we carry a token. It shares part of its life force with us. Alzahakar has some theories of his own on this."
FourCouncilor		tos	~kDrechx says, "The city of Tos suffers from old age. All things in life must age, whether living or stone, and poor Tos rests on her last legs. Only new life can restore her walls."
FourCouncilor		venya'cyr	~kDrechx says, "A truly despicable character.  She killed her own brother, Ker'toth."
FourCouncilor		Zarrus	~kDrechx says, "Nope."
FourCouncilor		Zarrus	~kDrechx says, "Who?"
FourCouncilor	MOOD_BAD		~kClosing his eyes and relaxing his body, Drechx enters a deep trance.
FourCouncilor	MOOD_GOOD		~kDrechx begins to rigorously exercise.
FourCouncilor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kDrechx says, "breathe in... breathe out... breathe in deeply... breathe out deeply... "
FourCouncilor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kDrechx says, "My body is my temple. If you don't eat better, your body will be your junkyard."
FourCouncilor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kDrechx says, "What did you have to eat today? The best food is the most natural food."
FourCouncilor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kDrechx says, "If you want to live to see my age, you best eat better and exercise your mind and body often."
FourCouncilor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kDrechx says, "How often do you exercise each day? I'm guessing not enough."
FourCouncilor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kDrechx says, "What matters if you change the town you live in? The only true house that you own is your body and that address you can not change."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "My fellow councilors are always looking to retrieve the mysterious tokens. We have been tasked with studying them. You'll find each of us have our own theories on how they function."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "The quickest way to recover is to rest at an inn and have yourself a good, warm meal."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "If you want your body to be more resilient, well, you'll have to break it down so that it can heal stronger. Might I say by taking on creatures that are tougher than you."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "A good place to hone your body is in the Arena of Kraanan. You might get some bruises... but you won't face death like combats out in the wild."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "While armor may be good protection, I think it just burdens you down."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "The Tokens are wonderful creatures. Others might call them objects, but I know they have a certain life to them. I have some theories on why that is."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "You'll heal a lot faster if you have a full stomach."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "Now a human has to watch after their own body, but if you want a little help, the ways of Shal'ille can teach you a healing spell."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "I've been out swimming far out in that great big ocean. Those rumors of sea creatures are nonsense. I don't know why they don't sail to deep waters anymore, but I don't believe in sea monsters."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "I've seen over sixty five winters. That's a lot, my friend. You don't see sixty five winters by being careless with your body. Some men and women half my age aren't in nearly as good a shape. Ha, I show them, I do."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "I'm particular to the Demon Skull token because it seems the most negative towards life force. I gather that whatever beast it came from was diametrically opposed to life. Being the healthiest councilor, it's best that I keep track of it."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "This old castle here, it's the oldest structure in the land. I'm surprised it's still standing. Perhaps the spirit of ancient King Far'Nohl keeps it from crumbling to dust."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx chants, "Ohm... Ohm... Ohm... say it with me now... Ohm... Ohm... Ohm... "
FourCouncilor			~kThe horrid smell of decay comes from the ancient castle.
FourCouncilor			~kYou have an uncomfortable feeling as you stand before the ancient castle, as if mankind was not meant to return to these walls.
FourCouncilor			~kInhuman screams can be heard from within the dark castle.
FourCouncilor			~kJust standing before the immense, dark structure, you are overwhelmed with an eerie feeling.
GuildCreator		barloque	~kFrular says, "Barloque doth house a favored hall of mine. The Hall of Explorers lies 'round the eastern corner here in south Barloque."

GuildCreator		bye	~kFrular says, "Fare thee well."
GuildCreator		cor NOTH	~kFrular says, "'Twas King Zarcos IV, who demanded the priest's temple exist not within the walls of the cities. I could not let that abandoned Shal'ille temple go to ruin in the middle of Cor Noth. A fine guild hall it has made."
GuildCreator		council	~kFrular says, "I have more than enough politics with mine chartered guilds and truly care not for the council's state affairs."
GuildCreator		duke	~kFrular says, "Even under Akardius, my halls are safe from search and seizure."
GuildCreator		hello	~kFrular says, "Hail , %NAME!"
GuildCreator		help	~kFrular says, "If thou wish to make thy guild official, then thou shouldst buy a title from me. I maintain the records on Guild Halls."
GuildCreator		jaarba	~kFrular says, "Jaarba had paranoia in great measure. Before his affliction of insanity, he housed a small group of rebels. His abode is most unique in its maze layout."
GuildCreator		Jasper	~kFrular says, "No more bizarre town is there than yonder Jasper. What tales I could tell thee about Jaarba's Abode and the Wryn's Keep!"
GuildCreator		marion	~kFrular says, "I hold no leases in Marion. They tolerate not the troubles that guilds bring forth."
GuildCreator		princess	~kFrular says, "Hail the Princess. It is through her grace that I am able to lease these halls. Yet, in truth, the Princess doth tax me too much."
GuildCreator		sell	~kFrular says, "I rent the finest guilds halls in the land."
GuildCreator		tos	~kFrular says, "For centuries, Konima's Dwelling lay vacant in Tos awaiting the hero's return. I was only granted lease of said property with the clause that should Konima himself ask for it back, the building would be immediately emptied and the keys presented to him."
GuildCreator		wryn	~kFrular says, "In days of yore, the mayor of Jasper sought to extract himself from the sovereignty of the crown. He had dug a great keep within the south mines, a perfect palace to hole up in  the event of siege. No war came about. The King knew that the Mayor would eventually lose his fire as the mine's gold was depleted. I found it to be a rather reasonable lease from the town."
GuildCreator	MOOD_BAD		~kFrular says, "I grow weary of dealing with the petty squabbling of these guilds. For certain, their bickering only serves to profit me, but mayhap more money is worth not the pains mine ears endure when they whine like babes."
GuildCreator	MOOD_BAD		~kFrular says, "I am a very busy man. Seat thyself and wait or seek to come back at another time."
GuildCreator	MOOD_GOOD		~kFrular says, "At the castle, thou will find fair Madelia. I take her to be sweet and supple. A most entertaining hostess is she. I protest unto thee, speak not to mine wife about these words."
GuildCreator	MOOD_GOOD		~kFrular says, "Mayhaps, I should retire and buy this city for myself and buy Cor Noth for the fair Madelia... How Now! How long hast thou been standing there?"
GuildCreator	MOOD_GOOD		~kFrular says, "Can life become better than 'tis now? Guilds abound and mine profits soar to the sky above."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "I grow weary of dealing with fledgling guilds of little intention. I tell thee truly, I have canceled more than one charter in my time."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "There are many ways to take possession of a Hall from another guild. But thou must be patient, cunning and determined, indeed. So many believe they possess said talents, but only the best succeed."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Take care in who thou asks to join thy guild. I've heard many a tale of new members outnumbering the old and ousting the master in favor of their own."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "A sad thing is those lonely men who hath true belief they can take the world by themselves. A man who hath no allies shall prosper nary a whit."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Yon globe is for established Guild Masters to post their charter or to appeal for more members."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Mayhaps, plenty of guild halls would be well received. Yet I do find the treaty breaking and subterfuge to be more interesting drama."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "I care not how a guild comes to possess my halls, only that they are kind enough to pay the rent."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "How fickle the boons of friendship. Friends make thee stronger. Yet, friends make thee more vulnerable as well."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "'Tis a sad guild that has but one or two members. In truth, I will traffic not with them and will endeavor to revoke the charter."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Let me tell thee in hushed tones, ~I I believe that popinjay Herbutte spends his idle hours listening through yon wall."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Hmm. My book shows me an error in a certain guild's charter. I've half a mind to revoke them."
GuildCreator			~kThrough the western wall, you can hear the muffled sound of someone yelling. You can't quite make out what is said.
GuildCreator			~kFrular flips through his book, casually checking that the guild charters are in proper order.
GuildCreator			~kOn the floor behind Frular, you can see a spool of fine golden thread.
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "My favored guildhall comes with the name the Bookmaster's Guild House. If managed with half a knat's brain, the guild who inhabits her can make shillings in great measure by openning her doors to the public."

HunterGhost		ancients	~kTendrath says, "I know little of the story of the ancients.  I have heard many versions.  All of them make reference to a being that is not from this world but who 'sleeps' within our world.  The end of the world arrives when this creature fully wakes from its slumber."
HunterGhost		Brax	~kTendrath says, "It was my city.  I am told that the people of Brax are no more.  That the purity of our people has been mingled with the blood of inferiors.  What is there to say?  Shall I tell you of how each person in Brax was born with magic within them.  That each persons' magic was unique.  That their character's were strong and honest.  They are no more and to speak of them gives me great pain."
HunterGhost		deformity	~kTendrath says, "The King of Brax had a curved spine and towards the end of his reign, had no voice whatsoever."
HunterGhost		Duke	~kTendrath says, "I hope this man is a strong leader.  If he is not we shall all feel the power of the ancients."
HunterGhost		Far Nohl	~kTendrath says, "He was the last man to travel the Nexus.  His authority and influence with the people came from his link to the Nexus.  The Nexus would take him to other worlds.  He would return from these other worlds with treasures and devices and knowledge.  The people worshipped him until the Nexus disappeared.  Castle Victoria was his home."
HunterGhost		Faren	~kTendrath says, "He is your god of nature.  I know him then.  Or rather I know of his kind.  Let us hope he still wields great power."
HunterGhost		guilt	~kTendrath says, "Before the King was murdered by Venya'cyr.  Kara'set had come to the princess and voiced her disapproval of the King.  There were certain military groups that felt his deformity could give their enemies the idea that the country was weak.  I know it sounds foolish.  You must understand the people of Brax to understand why Kara'set felt this way.  In some way Kara'set felt like she helped convince her closest friend to murder her brother."
HunterGhost		Hunter	~kTendrath says, "Upon being buried under ground, I found that my spirit did not depart this world as I would have thought.  For many years I could not comprehend the reason for this.  I existed only with my grief and my loneliness.  Then, slowly, the rocks began to move and I saw that the Lich was not dead.  She certainly was in no way human any more.  I knew then, why I had not left this place.  My task was not complete."
HunterGhost		Kara Set	~kTendrath says, "She was the most ferocious warrior Brax ever had.  She was Venya'cyr's close friend.  When Venya'cyr murdered the King, her own brother, Kara'set knew that her friend was no more. I personally saw Kara'set slay nearly three score necromancers on her way towards the palace and the Lich.  If anyone ever had the magic to kill the Lich it was her.  To face such things the soul must be pure.  Within Kara'set, the Lich saw a blemish.  Deep within the warrior there was guilt."
HunterGhost		Ker'Toth	~kTendrath says, "He was my King.  His sister murdered him.  His sister was Venya'cyr.  It was the powers of the Urn that originally corrupted the soul of the young princess.  It was this power which enabled the princess to sacrifice her own brother and leave a people without a leader."
HunterGhost		Kraanan	~kTendrath says, "These are your gods.  I suggest you pray to them."
HunterGhost		Lich	~kTendrath says, "The Lich is the first manifestation of an ancient presence within this world.  There is a story of a creature, older than the world, that sleeps within it.  I believe the Lich's powers springs from this creature.  I understand that you have many gods.  It would be best if these beings aided us now.  Let us hope they listen to your prayers.  Whether they do or not, you can be assured that I will never rest until she is gone. I have learned not to count on the gods."
HunterGhost		Necromancer amulet	~kTendrath says, "I have only seen amulets on the rotting corpses of the Lich's minions.  Their magic is strange and foreign.  It is not the power of death that they hold.  Death is a natural thing.  Pendants are the vein which transform life into UNDEATH."
HunterGhost		Necromancer	~kTendrath says, "They must be destroyed at all costs!  Those vile monsters crave nothing but total consumption of all life forces here in Meridian.  They are the pathetic pawns of their queen.  If you destroy them you weaken the Lich.  If you defeat the Lich the necromancers will be destroyed.  Of course, Venya'cyr can never be killed.  You must find a way to contain her infectious power.  Defeating her gives you a temporary respite, but we are all fated to watch her rise again."
HunterGhost		Nexus	~kTendrath says, "My grandfather remembers the Nexus.  It was a portal.  King Fahr'nohl would travel through the Nexus.  He brought many fine things to our world but I am sure he also brought many things that were dangerous.  When the Nexus disappeared, Fahr'nohl was finished. His power lay in his ability to travel the nexus and return.  His majesty faded and Castle Victoria was all but abandoned."
HunterGhost		princess	~kTendrath says, "I hope the lessons of the past do not escape this child."
HunterGhost		Qor	~kTendrath says, "This dark god may have ties to the ancients. Beware this one. She is the youngest child of an old family."
HunterGhost		Riija	~kTendrath says, "These are your gods. I suggest you pray to them."
HunterGhost		Shal'ille	~kTendrath says, "These are your gods.  Let us hope they will help their followers."
HunterGhost		sword of the hunt	~kTendrath says, "While the army lay siege to Brax, I spent weeks calling the magic of the earth.  Never before had I used my magic on weapons.  But I transformed the swords of the most brave into instruments of destruction.  The spirit of the sword was linked to its owner.  The link was strongest when they sought vengeance.  The swords deliver retribution."
HunterGhost		three of the Urn	~kTendrath says, "These devilish beings are but shadows that plague the living and coax them towards their own dark designs."
HunterGhost		tos	~kTendrath says, "They were timid warriors.  Let us hope that has at least changed."
HunterGhost		Underground caves	~kTendrath says, "When Kara'set was slain by the lich, all was lost.  Our greatest warrior was defeated.  The army had suffered many losses and retreated.  We had lost the swords within the walls of Brax.  The murderer of my son would go unpunished.  I sat alone.  I heard a sound and looked around.  A small animal was running into a large fissure in the ground.  Inside that fissure I found caves that led deep into the ground.  For days I traveled.  A huge cavern lay beneath our city.  There were ancient artifacts there from some forgotten people.  It was then that I knew what to do."
HunterGhost		urn	~kTendrath says, "I know little of the Urn. I have never seen it.  I know only that it was uncovered by a craftsman working on the foundation of the new palace. Within the Urn lurk the Three of the Urn."
HunterGhost		Venya'cyr	~kTendrath says, "I was told longer after my eldest son's murder that it was, indeed, the Three of the Urn who first brought my name to the ears of Venya'cyr.  Her spirit was so foul.  Upon the words of demons she sent those men to my house!  To ensure her own immortality, she destroyed the bloodline that was my family.  She murdered my son, thinking it was me.  I was a simple man.  I would have suffered many things for our leader.  I asked for none of this.  But now... Now I will never rest until I see that creature gone from this world forever."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Oh my son.  I shall avenge you.  I shall never stop until she is dead."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Where has the sun gone?  It has been a thousand years since I have seen the sun."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Beware the Necromancers.  They dwell here. Beware."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Tordos is that you?  Oh, I thought my son had come to get me.  He was killed by Venya'cyr you know.  For that, she will pay."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Shhh.  The lich dwells here.  She will hunger for the life within you. You must destroy her, if you wish your children to grow up in safety."
Izzio		Brax	~kIzzio almost stops smiling, "Well you know that really isn't my kind of place."
Izzio		buy	~kIzzio says, "I wish it weren't so but I have nothing for you today."
Izzio		Duke	~kIzzio says, "Poor boy."
Izzio		Duke	~kIzzio says, "For all the world he seems a nice enough chap."
Izzio		Faction	~kIzzio says, "From my experience I have found it unwise to swear allegiance to anyone above your own self, but that's just my opinion."
Izzio		Faction	~kIzzio says, "Politics really don't peak my interest."
Izzio		Faction Troops	~kIzzio says, "That isn't for me, I like my limbs where they are."
Izzio		Faren	~kIzzio says, "Now there is a school worthy of attention.  Faren at least recognizes the power and wonder of nature itself."
Izzio		Hunters	~kIzzio says, "It's not my place to make judgments on anyone."
Izzio		Jala	~kIzzio says, "Minstrels are the most delightful folk."
Izzio		Jonas	~kIzzio sighs, "A man with his eyes to power, 'tis sad."
Izzio		Junk	~kIzzio says, "Some people call me a junk dealer, I prefer to think of myself as a procurer of unwanted memories."
Izzio		Kateriina/Akardius	~kIzzio says, "Ah, I do believe I smell love in the air."
Izzio		Kraanan	~kIzzio says, "Well fighting has never been my strong suit, but I hear it is a worthwhile school for some."
Izzio		Miriana	~kIzzio says, "You know that I would never seek to offend, but there is something odd about that lass that bears watching.  If I were you, I would keep my eyes and ears open around her."
Izzio		necromancer amulet	~kIzzio smiles broadly, "I bet that would fetch a pretty penny."
Izzio		Necromancers	~kIzzio says, "Well folk are folk no matter who they worship."
Izzio		Princess	~kIzzio says, "Aye, and a sweet young lass she is, with a refreshing outlook on the world."
Izzio		Qor	~kIzzio says, "A useful school to study if you have the stomach for it."
Izzio		Riija	~kIzzio says, "Well personally I love a good prank."
Izzio		Shal'ille	~kIzzio says, "A wonderful path to take for those thus inclined."
Izzio		sword of the hunt	~kIzzio says, "I can respect the owner of one of those."
Izzio		Tendrath	~kIzzio says, "I once knew a mime with that name."
Izzio		Venya'Cyr	~kIzzio says, "You might want to ask Miriana."
Izzio	MOOD_BAD		~kIzzio eyes you suspiciously and grumbles sleepily, "No darned person in their right mind awakens this early."
Izzio	MOOD_GOOD		~kIzzio spreads his arms wide and takes a deep breath, "Ah, I love the night so peaceful and quiet.  Gives me such a pleasure to enjoy nature as it was meant."
Izzio			~kIzzio says, "That is a matter I would need to think on."
Izzio			~kIzzio mumbles, "Twelve minus three, divided by two, carry the one...Oh hello there, beautiful day isn't it?"
Izzio			~kIzzio says, "I hear some talk of beautiful cities, I don't see how they could compare with natures own majesty."
Izzio			~kIzzio whistles happily, although slightly out of tune.
Izzio			~kIzzio perfectly imitates the call of the forest birds.
Izzio			~kIzzio closes his eyes and sighs contentedly, "This is living."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	army	~kYevitan says, "You may want to see Jonas about that."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD	barloque	~kYevitan says, "'Tis a gilded cage, that forsaken city. A velvet prison tended by a gang of thieves and in-bred imbeciles, where sense is a liability and an honest opinion is dangerous to those that expressed it. Be gone now, I'll say no more. I am weary of you."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD	barloque	~kYevitan says, "Ah, yes, Barloque was my home for many years while I was in service to the King. At one point it was the seat of imperial power in Meridian, though now a ghost of a city sits in its' place. Ghostly remnants. It's no longer the center of anything, except Meridian's own sewer system."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL	barloque	~kYevitan says, "I lived for years in Barloque, but now I'm happy to be back among my people here. Never really felt that I fit in there, that I belonged to the place. Perhaps it is the way that they speak there, they have a strange way of speaking, you know, elitist. In any event, it isn't very welcoming."
JasperBanker		blindness	~kYevitan says, "Tell me, is this something that you have the dedication to pursue? Is this something that you have talked over with Zuxana? You must be very careful where you tread in these matters."
JasperBanker		bye	~kYevitan says, "Good bye."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD	cor NOTH	~kYevitan says, "What about it? You are irritating me with your inane questions."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD	cor NOTH	~kYevitan says, "To tell you the truth, I never go there for any reason, but the reasons are entirely personal. You see, I cannot go to Cor Noth without running into that little rodent Parrin Aragone, a man I have never been able to tolerate in any amount."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL	cor NOTH	~kYevitan says, "Well, not my favorite city personally."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD	council	~kYevitan says, "What now? Council? Go on, knave, out!"
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD	council	~kYevitan says, "Impotent old men."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL	council	~kYevitan says, "Sort of an interim government, I suppose."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	denthan	~kYevitan says, "Ah, yes, the great battle of Denthan Crossing. It is a turning point in our history; that is the history of the Jasper people, for it marks the end of our independence when the Wryn's army was defeated there by the forces of Zarcos II. But true to the spirit of the Jasper people, it also marked the end of Zarcos II. My people saw to that. He never left that field."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kYevitan snarls, "What?  I don’t owe anything to that little Riija puppy.  I’ve paid my debt to his Uncle, and I have the records to prove it too."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kYevitan says, "You want to talk about that no good, self aggrandizing, pompous fool? That man is no more concerned for this land and its citizens than you or I concern ourselves with the fate of another baby spider, one way or the other. Well, he'll never be a King, that's certain. And if the issue is ever in doubt I'll see to it myself, by the gods I will. If that day comes, I'll take care of him myself... "
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kYevitan says, "Yea. What about the inane little dribbler?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	frular	~kYevitan says, "There are many in this kingdom with a critical eye on Frular of Barloque. And I will not stand here and say that this is unwarranted. But say what you will about him, he is a genius at making investments that in turn make money. Genius. I have never seen the like of the man, even Bei Naq on his best day, which was of course years before you were even born... "
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	gerah springers	~kYevitan says, "Yes, the Baron of Cor Noth or some such claptrap. Another of many within the Royal Court with nothing to do but exercise their boredom in public. Their time will come, though, you will see."
JasperBanker		hello	~kYevitan says, "Yes? What is it that I can do for you?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	herbutte	~kYevitan says, "Herbutte? That pompous boob. The Royal Court is full of his like, pretentious toadies squirming past each other for table scraps. And I should know, because for all my years at Court, all of my dedicated service to His Majesty Zarcos V, it was people like this Herbutte who always made it a point to remind me that after all I was only from Jasper. ~IOnly~I from Jasper and therefore only fit for a temporary position among the so-called elite."
JasperBanker		jasper	~kYevitan says, "Well, it is a curious place to the outsider. . . but it is a place of great potential. Huh? Great ~Ipotential~I. A tougher people do not exist anywhere. Or a more loyal people. And loyalty means everything in this world, with all it's twists and turns, and twisting around. These people are coming out of the mountains, and defining the political future of this land."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	joguer	~kYevitan says, "Haven't seen the man in years. Oh, must be ten years now at least. He was always a bit, you know, affected."
JasperBanker		jonas	~kYevitan says, "Ah, as fine a man as I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.  Strong willed, sound of mind, and with such a glorious vision.  He has my full support."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	justicar	~kYevitan says, "Now that's a new system since my time at Court. But what a laugh. A toothless position of no authority, open to the highest bidder. That's our justice? Oh, okay then... "
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD	king	~kYevitan says, "Are you asking me where the King is? Is that what you want to know? Bah! Even if I knew what makes you think I would tell you? Take thee away, fool. I haven't the energy for you and your prattle."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD	king	~kYevitan says, "Well, understand that he is a very old friend, regardless of how he was as a ruler for this kingdom. He wasn't particularly well suited to be King ever, too sensitive, too vulnerable. He is in a safe place now. You realize he'd better be, for if he shows his face he is a dead man. There are powerful people in this land who cannot afford to have him making unexpected appearances."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL	king	~kYevitan says, "The King is in hiding. Exiled, hiding, whatever you choose to call it. But you would know that already, for that news common knowledge."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	lady aftyn	~kYevitan says, "Lady Aftyn is a loyal friend to Zarcos, and I must say that despite her beliefs a friend of my ally is a friend to me. I am watching her carefully."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD	marion	~kYevitan says, "What? Marion? Why do you waste my time with your incessant chatter? I'm just trying to run a bank here."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kYevitan says, "Marion fits key into the political landscape of Meridian, although you would never guess it by judging its sleepy appearances. Marion is a royalist stronghold, loyal to the King."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL	marion	~kYevitan says, "A very modest region, with rather modest ambition and means."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	meidei	~kYevitan says, "Strange fellow. Heard that he's become possessed by some fever of religious fanaticism. In the years that I knew him well, he served drinks and kept abreast of the local gossip. Tipped a few glasses back himself, as well. And now he has found Shal'ille? Well that should tell you something."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	obert cair'bre	~kYevitan says, "Master Cair'bre is a most upstanding gentleman, and a personal friend of mine for some years. I would trust my every possession to his care without any hesitation, regardless of its' value."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kYevitan says, "A nice girl, but a girl is all she is.  She’ll never had the spine nor the wit to make a competent ruler."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kYevitan says, "Although she has many endearing qualities, I can tell you with confidence that the quality of leadership is not among them. Certainly royalty has its place in this kingdom, but I insist that we are ready for more dynamic leadership. I suggest this in your utmost confidence, but when the time comes for an army to march down from these hills to instill a new King or Queen to the throne, where will you be, my friend?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kYevitan says, "Most courteous and understanding, qualities that she inherited from her late mother, the late Queen Katria."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	qor	~kYevitan says, "There are reasons that all of our gods occupy the positions that they do. If you wish to find out more about Qor, I suggest that you seek out the Priestess Zuxana. She will instruct you as to where to begin your education."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD	tos	~kYevitan says, "You ask too many questions for your own good."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kYevitan says, "Well... Tos is a rather old fashioned city with a rather fashionable political climate, if you know what I mean. The people of Tos are more concerned with the appearance of taking action than they are with actually taking action themselves, or with the consequences. It's a simple place, really. Full of... well, simpletons."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL	tos	~kYevitan says, "Hmmm? Tos? It was alive and well last time I passed through the gates."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	tova	~kYevitan says, "A remarkable man... not what he appears, I assure you."
JasperBanker		whiskey	~kYevitan says, "Troll whiskey? Listen to me and listen good, you'd better just get right on out of here before there's trouble."
JasperBanker		zig	~kYevitan looks at you very closely.
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD	zuxana	~kYevitan says, "She is a mystery. An immensely powerful mystery. For what moves Qor and his servants? That is a question I fear that no one can answer."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kYevitan says, "Do you bring news? Is that what you are doing here, little messenger gnat? News from the kingdom? Bah, you bore me. Get thee gone, imp."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kYevitan says, "Has the Duke sent you to bother me to death, is that why you are still here? He is a man of such unremarkable talents it would surprise me to find out he had hired someone's village idiot to monopolize my time now that I no longer have any ties to him.  He just can't stand that someone has broken free of his slimy little grip can he?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kYevitan says, "If you want my advice, which you seem to young %SIRMADAM, I would advise you to keep your banking business confined within these four walls. You may make up your own mind about the situation, but I feel that Skivlat at the First Royal Bank in Tos is not as ~Idiligent~I as he could be. He strikes me as a bit of the strange type, you see. Quite strange indeed."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kYevitan says, "As if it were not enough that I am plagued by the Gerah Springers and Herbuttes of this world, you choose to occupy my time and my place of business for whatever senseless reason that you might have. Go on. I am an old man in Jasper, for Qor's sake, and I really don't have time for you."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kYevitan says, "Are you wasting my time? Go and speak your mind with Joguer, I haven't the patience for thee and thine own."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kYevitan says, "This is a bank, not a fishmonger's shack. Take your gossip elsewhere, I have business to attend to."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kYevitan says, "What do you require, outsider?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kYevitan says, "If you have business with the bank today, kindly conduct that business and we can both get on with our other obligations."
JasperBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kYevitan says, "Look, I don't have time to chat with you. I don't care to anyway, so get out of here. Go on. Get."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "An old man learns ways to survive, or he doesn't ever become an old man at all. If you need to get away with murder, and sooner or later everybody does, it's a good idea that nobody sees you. I know a trick for that. But its Qor magic, and you need to have some understanding of The Deceiver to use it."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "You will find that everybody knows a different side of the story. To the shrewd political operative all of this information is important, provided that you catalogue it for future use. The key, my friend, is how you ask and the mood of the person to whom you inquire. And, naturally, whatever you can do to improve that mood is of paramount importance... "
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "All of this political turmoil between the Duke Kalior and the young Princess seems to have a lot of citizens upset. And rightfully so! People need a proper government, that they can look up to, admire, and respect.  Just like what Jonas and I are trying to bring to the land now."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "It's an uncertain world, but you can keep your financial status quite secure by keeping your money in this institution."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "Adventuring about is fine, but at the end of the day you need to consider your financial situation! Money defines the world within which we live, my friend. The ~Ioperating~I world."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "A young, industrious person like yourself can earn favor by running errands, carrying messages and the like for people between the towns of Meridian."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "Have you spoken with Hester Gilk in Cor Noth? She has resources you might find useful, at some point in your travels... "
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "There is too much focus on the Duke and the Princess. People are failing to see the truth of the situation, which is that neither of those two parties is suitable to rule! That's right, unsuitable. I'm an old man, with the courage to admit it. I know our people realize this but everyone is afraid to see the truth, and certainly afraid to say a word. What kind of political situation is that?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "There is even more trouble than before, now that Akardius is Duke. He and the Princess it appears are back at square one. The conflict begins anew.  The perfect time for a new player to enter the game, eh?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "Who will be the next King or Queen of this land? Look around you my friend. You? If your country calls to you, would you step forward to lead? Well then, I will tell you that it will not be me, that I can tell you, for I am an old man and my skills are better used to guide than to govern... but I will tell you this, I will have plenty to say about who it is. Remember that, and remember that Jonas has my full support."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "As my dear friend King Zarcos V always said to me, 'Spare the luxuries to spoil the savings'. That is royal advice, %LADLASSIE, but didn't I train him well?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "Jasper shall be bigger than ever...very soon."
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "Qor smiles upon businessmen and rebels, for you see there is a system even to breaking the system... "
JasperBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kYevitan says, "How lovely to see you again, %NAME! I sincerely hope you have been prosperous in the meanwhile, and have managed to avoid the Duke and his band of cutthroats."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "Any deposit that you make remains safe here in my vaults, no matter what may befall the depositor. That is the policy of the Royal Bank of Jasper, and you have my word on it as a businessman."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "It is a hard world my friend, one in which, I am afraid, your net worth to the powers that be may be tabulated as easily as counting beans. One, two, three, four, etc., etc.. That is the reality of a political system based solely upon economic constructs. We aren't asked whether or not we like it this way, but this is how we must live until we summon the strength to make a change."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "It's true that I spent many years in the service of our last King, Zarcos V before settling into this business. I believe now that a private life suits me better than the atmosphere of the Royal Court. There is too much posturing over pedigrees and privilege in the Court."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "There are those even now who live in the sentimental delusion that Konima will return to this kingdom and deliver us from our present woes! Gone these two hundred and twenty some years, and he'll return now to dig us out of the mess that we've gotten ourselves into! Imagine?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "It is wise to stock up on all of your essentials before leaving Jasper, to ensure your safe passage through the mountains. Jasper is not a large town by any means, but the quality of our goods is unsurpassed."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "There are so many new travelers in our land, and so much new opportunity. We are poised on the brink of a changing world, my friend."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "If you deposit your money here at the Royal Bank, you may also conduct business on your account at the First Royal Bank in Tos, for although the Duke no longer owns both institutions, I find it much more calming to my customers that the banks work together."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "I certainly hope that you don't mistake the tentative nature of the Jasper people for unfriendliness. On the contrary, these are good, strong people who are excellent at recognizing that which is best, and the worst, of outsiders."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "You must always consider your equity, my friend."
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "Yes, can I help you? Some financial advice perhaps?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "Do you have a deposit today, %NAME?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kYevitan says, "What can I do for you, %NAME?"
JasperBanker	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kYevitan says, "Both Qor and Shal'ille spell casters will find their abilities heightened the more extreme their karma."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	afiera d'xor	~kPietro says, "Whaz the matter with you you can't keep your nose in your own bizniz!?! ~Iwho~I ARE you, anywayz?"
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	afiera d'xor	~kPietro says, "Crazy old coot. ~IYou'll~I schtay away from him, if ~Iyou~I know whaz good for ~Iyou~I!! I'll schay nothing more on the subject, not a freggin' WORD."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	afiera d'xor	~kPietro says, "I don't know who you're talking about."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	barloque	~kPietro says, "Pox on you, pox on Barloque, pox on your anchestorz, pox on your freggin' bizniz!! Git out!!!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	barloque	~kPietro says, "~Ibarloque~I is the BOTTOM of the river, you know what I mean?? Well, let'z juscht schay you ~Idon't~I, although ~II'm~I not so schure ~Iabout that~I. I'm ~Inot~I so schure about that ~Iat all~I. But listen anywayz. The ~Iold people~I in thiz town talk about a ~Ischyschtem of schewerz~I that run under the WHOLE of Meridian, not juscht under Barloque where the ~Iratz~I come from... that schewerz ~Iconnect~I TOZ, JASPER, COR NOTH ~Iand Barloque~I, and that schyschtem empties at ~IBARLOQUE~I. That means that Barloque, the ~IRoyal Capitol~I of this land, is the end of the line for ~Iall that~I SEWAGE, is one ~IBIG~I schewer... "
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	barloque	~kPietro says, "I don't travel much."
JasperBartender		broom	~kPietro says, "Broom? What freggin' ~Ibroom~I?"
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	buy	~kPietro says, "What, do I schtudder? Barz CLOZED, now ~Igit~I, hic, ~IGIT~I out!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	buy	~kPietro says, "I'd just as soon ~Ispit~I on you as ~Ischerve~I you a DRINK, donkey."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	bye	~kPietro says, "Thazz right, get on out. Go on. OUT!!!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	bye	~kPietro glances up to watch you leave.
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	bye	~kPietro says, "Humpf."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	cor NOTH	~kPietro says, "I ~Isuppoze~I thaz where YOU'RE from, dog, an I suppoze ~Ithiz town~I juz izn't up to your freggin' ~Istandardz~I, either."

Burn the rest of Meridian, and Jasper will schtill be here. ~ILet~I them do whatever they want, burn the whole freggin' stewpot down to the freggin' flat prairie it squatz on.."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	cor NOTH	~kPietro says, "It's supposed to be pretty nice there."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	council	~kPietro says, "Lizzen. Take your POLITICZ, and ~ISCHTICK~I them in your ~Igob~I."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	council	~kPietro says, "Conzil? They have tokens, and it ~Iiz sched~I that the tokenz can MOVE, ~Iall by theschelvz~I!!  I wonderz whatz in them there tokens that mashkes them able to move like that."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	council	~kPietro says, "Keep your freggin' politics to yourself, stranger. ~INo one~I here is interested in what you have to say about the council."
JasperBartender		drunk	~kPietro says, "Get LOST, ~Ijack azz~I."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kPietro says, "Itz none of your freggin' bizniz what I think, puke."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kPietro says, "That freggin' Duke ~Ihatez~I Jasper, and he hatez the peoplez from Jasper, too. And you know WHY? Thaz right, it'z ~Ibecausche~I he can't ~ICONTROL~I us, or this town, or any of it. ~IPOX~I on him. Pox on hiz armiez too, let him just march hiz armiez into theze hillz and schow us differently.

JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kPietro says, "I don't follow politics."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	hello	~kPietro abruptly says, "Yes, WHAT?!?"
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kPietro says, "What do you want?"
JasperBartender		honored	~kPietro spits, landing close to Jonas’ boot and turns away."
JasperBartender		Izzio	~kPietro says, "I ave only seen that man once or twice. He is wandering around.... Know what I mean? He tries to sell that garbage of his."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	jasper	~kPietro says, "Therez nothing for you in thiz town."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kPietro says, "Thiz town'z got more ~Isecretz~I than a Barloque harlot. And thaz ~Iall~I I'm going to schay on the matter. That is freggin' it. Not ANOTHER ~Iword~I. No. Not a ~IWORD~I."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jasper	~kPietro says, "You're obviously a stranger to these parts, so let me give you a little advice. Mind your own freggin' business in this town, same as everyone else."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	marion	~kPietro says, "Barz clozed. ~IGIT~I out."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kPietro says, "We ~Ihatez~I thoze people."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	marion	~kPietro says, "I don't know. Go see for yourself."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kPietro says, "What are you, a ~Ispy~I? Are you a ~ISPY~I? Git out of my bar, you freggin' Princess ~Ischpy~I you!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kPietro says, "The Princezz? Well, ~Inice~I and ~Itidy~I how she got her father to DISAPPEAR, ischn't it? I know, they ~Ischay~I that the King loscht hiz ~Imind~I, and I believe you me he ~Idid~I. But peoplez mindz can also be manipu... they can be manipulative... peoples minds can also be ~Imanipulated~I by magic and witchcraft, and after all who does the princezz schurround herschelf with but people of ~Imagic~I, sorcerers and mages. I'm not saying it wuz the princezz herschelf, but her faction HAZ done ~IVERY WELL~I for itself with the old man out of their way. If you aschk me, which ~Iyou did~I, it'z that Alzahakar that done it to the King like that. He knowz more about Riija than anyone realizez... "
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kPietro says, "She doesn't come here much, if you hadn't noticed."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	qesino	~kPietro looks at you for a long moment, shaking his head."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	qesino	~kPietro says, "Dizappeared on hiz way to Toz. Vanished into thin air, becuz thaz what we have up here in the mountainz, thin air. If you ask me though, and you did, his friggin' widow and her friggin' blacksmith boyfriend killed him, left hiz body up there in the freggin' mountainz, murdered him and took all the money he wuz headed to Toz with. Becauze he had a bundle with him, and that dizappeared too. HA!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	qesino	~kPietro says, "He left town."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	quintor	~kPietro says, "I don't want to freggin' know, and if you know whaz good for you, neither do you. But if you want the real schtory on Quintor, find his freggin' ex-wife! HA! You can bet sche'z with that miner sche ran off with, if you can find her, that iz. Bring a shovel when you go looking, becauze you'll have to dig up half this mountain to find them both. Might have to usche your imagination too, 'cause the piecez might not fit together scho good... that's what I mean by if you know what'z good for you... "
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	quintor	~kPietro says, "He'z doing better than ever before, better than anyone elze in thiz town if you know what I mean. But I guez you don't, or you wouldn't be azking. Okay, let me schpell it out for you. He should be doing freggin' fine, since he freggin' murdered old man Qesino and moved in with hiz freggin' wife! Don't you think you'd be doing pretty freggin' well if you freggin' murdered old man Qesino and moved in with hiz freggin' wife!?!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	quintor	~kPietro says, "He's the blacksmith in these parts. He's just across the way, and if you've got business with him you should discuss it with him."
JasperBartender		secret	~kPietro says, "Plenty of SCHEECRETS in these mountains. You ~Iwatch your step~I, or you could become ~Ione~I of them."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	tos	~kPietro says, "Get out of here. NOBODY in theez partz iz, ~Ihic~I, iz ~Iinterested~I in the wayz of that stink-hole Toz, or ~Inobody~I from there neither."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kPietro says, "Toz is really ~Ithe schite of ancient EVIL~I. They schay that at night ~Ithe dead get up and rize~I in Toz, that they ~Iwalk the earth~I. The city itschelf is built upon ~Ithe ancient schtronghold of Qor~I. Thatz RIGHT!! ~IANCIENT EVIL~I!! And ~Ischomeday schoon~I that evil will make itschelf known to Meridian, and thiz land will not be the schame!! The bodies of those flatlanderz will be schtacked in big moundz, ~Ischacrificez~I to the ~IEVIL QOR~I and to their own ~Iignorance~I. ~IHumpf~I. HUMPH!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	tos	~kPietro says, "Never been there."
JasperBartender		whiskey	~kPietro says, "Troll Whiskey iz illegal, or didn't you know? I don't know nothing about Troll Whiskey, all I sell here is beer. Beer, thaz it. Period."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	widow	~kPietro says, "You ask too many questions, stranger, schticking your noze around where you got no biznez. Why don't you leave Jasper while you still got a noze on your freggin' face."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	widow	~kPietro says, "Oh. yes, the bereaving widow. She'z so freggin' broken up about her husband'z dizappearance, that she freggin' shacked up with the blacksmith!! Thick as thieves, thaz right, thick as freggin' thieves. But you didn't hear that from me... "
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	widow	~kPietro says, "She runs the inn, just down the street."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD	yevitan	~kPietro says, "Therez ~Inobody~I in thesche partz by that mane, ~ISTRANGER~I."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	yevitan	~kPietro says, "That old man haz got hiz own planz, that I know. Did you know that in hiz younger, ~Ihic~I, hiz younger dayz he was the ~IFinancial Minischter~I to~Ithe King~I? Thaz RIGHT. ~Ipowerful~I man. They threw him out, too. when the, hic, when the King loscht hiz mind.

I ~Ibet you~I that schomeday ~Ischoon~I he goes right back down there and takez back what he'z due. And GOOD FOR HIM!!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	yevitan	~kPietro says, "Yes, the banker. Royal Bank of Jasper."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD	zhieu b'hob	~kPietro says, "Schtupid... idiot... schtupid idiot. And ~Igreedy~I... "
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kPietro says, "~IHit~I the freggin' ROAD."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kPietro says, "Did you need something? No? No? Well then, you freggin' get going."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kPietro says, "If I wuz you, dungface, I'd walk out of here while you still can."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kPietro says, "Hit the brickz, you freggin' road trash. Pietroz iz C-L-O-S-E-D."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kPietro screams, "WHAT!?!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kPietro yells, "OUT! Everyone freggin' OUT!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kPietro grumbles, "Stinkin rebelz, ~IHic~I, freggin' good for nothin loutz, ~IHic~I, come inz an take o’er myz bar.  Thez don’t even askz me if’n I’m willin."
JasperBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kPietro shouts, "The bar iz closed. Get out."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kPietro says, "Drink! Eat! Rest up here while you can, you'll ~Ineed~I your schtrength for fighting monschters and BAD people in her..out there! ~Ihic~I!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kPietro says, "I have HEARD, ~Ihic~I, that a great warrior reschides in Cor Noth, a maschter warrior don't shou know. He wuz the ~Icaptain of the Royal Guardz, okay? He is schupposed to know all that there iz to know about battling monschsters, and demonz, and schuch... "
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kPietro says, "Barloque iz the royal capitol of all the land outschide Jasper, and a place overwhelming with wealth. Aschk Yevitan about it, he usched to LIVE there."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kPietro says, "Schtay away from the trollz in thesche hillz, they are deadly. DEADLY. The orcz too, becauze they will schometimez form ~IWAR PARTIES~I and ~Iraid~I the human townz! Yes! ~Ivery~I dangerouz!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kPietro says, "I could ~Itell~I you a few thinzz about thiz town that would ~Imake~I your hairz schtand on their enz. Thazz RIGHT. On their freggin' enz."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kPietro says, "Schtart aschking questions around here, and you don't ever know what you might turn up. Probably ~Iwouldn't~I WANT to know, neither."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kPietro says, "You ~Iwatch~I your step around here, stranger. Schomeone will freggin' hit you over the freggin' HEAD and take your money. Even ~Ihappenz to localz~I, you can believe me there, scho don't go thinking you're ANYTHING FRIGGIN' SCHPECIAL... "
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kPietro says, "Even ~IJasper's~I got it'z schare of IDIOTZ. No namez ~Imentioned~I, but that Zhieu B'hob is a freggin' horschez rump. Dumb az a cedar freggin' post."
JasperBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kPietro says, "Yevitan, now he'z a wize old bugger. He'z got planz, BIG planz, but he wazn't schaying nothing till that Jonz, Jonarc, whatz hiz face came round. Schmart guy."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "Pick your path out of Jasper carefully, stranger. The road to the east is infested with an army of trolls and orcs, enough to challenge any army the freggin' flatlands could raise."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "People in these parts aren't like the rest of Meridian folks. It's a breed apart up here, and you'd best be mindful of the differences.  Especially now with Jonas and his gang, they don't like no one talking bad bout them."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "We didn't used to get so many strangers up here in the mountains.  Wish that damned Jonas and his guppies never thought to come here."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro is waiting to take your order.
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "There is a bank here in Jasper, just around the corner. It is left over from the days that the freggin' mines prospered."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "Hey, you gonna buy a beer, or what? This isn't a freggin' flophouse!!!"
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "If you're here to drink and eat, then drink and eat. I don't have time for your damned conversation."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "You're better off by not asking too many questions in these parts. We like our privacy."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "Money freggin' talks in this land, so you better figure out how to freggin' get it."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "You might be surprised at what you can find out by just listening."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "I don't care where you sleep, but you're not sleeping here."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro grumbles, "It used to be nice and quiet round these here parts.  Haven't been this many loafers round since the mines dried up."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "We like things the way they are in these parts."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "You don't want to freggin' start no trouble here."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "~IHic~I."
JasperBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPietro says, "What do you need?"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	afiera	~kQuintor says, "Get out of my shop."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	afiera d'xor	~kQuintor says, "You'd best talk to Afiera D'xor if that's who you want to talk about."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	axe	~kQuintor says, "It's a great thing to have if you're gathering firewood, but to carry as a weapon? The graveyards in these hills are crowded with axe-carrying fools from the flatlands that went up against the orc scimitar."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	barloque	~kQuintor says, "This is Jasper. If you want to know about Barloque, beggar, head north until you get to the coast, then go east until you reach a sewer surrounded by walls. You can't miss it."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	barloque	~kQuintor says, "The fancy manners and dress of Barloque are a long way from Jasper, I assure you."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	barloque	~kQuintor says, "I've never been to the city of Barloque, so I'd be the wrong person to ask."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	b'hob 	~kQuintor says, "Get out of my shop."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	bye	~kQuintor says, "Be gone."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	bye	~kQuintor says, "Come back and see me when you're in these parts."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	cor NOTH	~kQuintor says, "Cor Noth? Well, I'd say it'd be a fine place for ~Ione~I such as you."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	cor NOTH	~kQuintor says, "They've got their heads stuck firmly in the ground in Cor Noth, to be sure. ~IUniversity~I. You would learn more in a week in these mountains than a lifetime at their so called ~Iuniversity~I."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	cor NOTH	~kQuintor says, "Although I have been to the city of Cor Noth, I was there as a visitor only. I know little of those people and their ways."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	council	~kQuintor says, "So what about them then? I don't have anything to say to you!"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	council	~kQuintor says, "I would rather not discuss politics."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	council	~kQuintor says, "I an too busy to try and keep up with politics."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	dagger	~kQuintor says, "A toy."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kQuintor says, "I think you should take your political opinions out of my shop, NOW!"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kQuintor says, "This Duke Akardius is as much a fool as Kalior. Meridian needs an honorable warrior, such as Jonas, to take the throne."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kQuintor says, "I don't know much about him."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	frular	~kQuintor says, "This man, Frular of Barloque, is alive without a soul or ancestors of merit. His business is to buy property and buildings all across the land in order to rent them for profit. BUT... this man Frular of Barloque especially wishes to acquire buildings that are sacred to their communities, and then defile them with his business dealings. He bought Wryn's Keep here in Jasper, which is the traditional fortress of the mountain warlord, and a Shal'ille temple in Cor Noth that I know of. Someday I will show him how wrong this is."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	hammer	~kQuintor says, "I wouldn't make a hammer to act as a weapon, and I don't know a respectable warrior that would fight with one either. A hammer, really. I know a few farmers that would try to fight with a hammer, but not a warrior. And I've known a few of the best."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	hello	~kQuintor says, "What do you want, beggar?"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	hello	~kQuintor says, "Yes, can I help you?"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kQuintor says, "Good %DAYNIGHT, stranger."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	jasper	~kQuintor says, "Not your cup of tea, eh? Just as well you figured it out the easy way."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kQuintor says, "I'll say this, it was a different place before the mines failed and all those outsiders left town, and now that Jonas is here with his so called ~Ifaction~I. But the people of Jasper have always been here, and always will. You could spend your life in Jasper and still not find out much about it, stranger. Sometimes it's better to let sleeping dogs lie."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jasper	~kQuintor says, "Take it face value, stranger. Just a sleepy mountain community where life is pretty simple."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	mace	~kQuintor says, "A mace is a child's weapon, better suited to crushing grapes than to actually fighting."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	marion	~kQuintor says, "I don't care about Marion, its problems, or your opinions on any of it. I think you were just leaving."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kQuintor says, "The people of Marion are complacent and stubborn. That's probably because all they have to contend with down on the flatlands are baby spiders and giant rats. No trolls, no orcs. Life must be pretty easy."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	marion	~kQuintor says, "Marion? Not much to say about it, it's just north where the land flattens out."
JasperBlacksmith		mining	~kQuintor says, "What reason do you have to go mining, stranger?"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	orc	~kQuintor says, "I am a blacksmith, not some soldier. Go about your business and leave me alone."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	orc	~kQuintor says, "Many think of them as a backwards race, but that is the ignorance of those that have not dealt with them firsthand. In these mountains, if you happen to run into an orc it will most likely be a lone warrior, but even alone orcs are formidable fighters and you must watch yourself. No one knows where their central fortress is or what happens there, but you can be sure that they are waiting for the time to come out in force, for they are capable of organizing and fielding large armies. When that day comes, we will all know it."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	orc	~kQuintor says, "The orcs are fearsome creatures that live up in these mountains. I have heard that there is also another breed that stays almost entirely underground, but that they are related in both blood and spirit."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	pietro	~kQuintor says, "If you have business with Pietro, I suggest that you take it up with him."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	pietro	~kQuintor says, "Get out of my shop."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kQuintor bellows, "The affairs of the Princess have absolutely no bearing in these parts, so if you have an opinion why don't you keep it to yourself!"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kQuintor says, "I'd rather discuss something else, if it's all the same to you."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kQuintor says, "I haven't got an opinion about her at all."
JasperBlacksmith		pupil	~kQuintor says, "I don't need no pupil right now. You best be on your way, stranger."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	scimitar	~kQuintor says, "I don't know anything about the scimitar."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	scimitar	~kQuintor says, "The scimitar is the sword of the orc hoards, a large, curve bladed weapon that is a fearsome weapon in the hands of those who have the skill. I have learned a few things wielding such a blade. Occasionally I will take a pupil under my wing and teach them some basic points."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	scimitar	~kQuintor says, "The scimitar is an orc blade, very advanced in its design. It puts to rest any ideas that those unfamiliar with the orcs often have about the orcs being a backwards race."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	sell	~kQuintor says, "I don't have anything you'd be interested in!"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	sell	~kQuintor says, "I have something that you must see."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	sell	~kQuintor says, "I might have something you'd be interested in."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	sword	~kQuintor says, "The sword is a warrior's weapon, and I have made my share."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	teach	~kQuintor angrily says, "I'm not taking pupils!"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	teach	~kQuintor says, "I might be able to teach you a few things about the scimitar. It is a unique weapon in its balance and weight, and requires dedication if you wish to master its subtlety. Perhaps I can help you begin your studies."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	teach	~kQuintor says, "It's true that I will occasionally take a pupil."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	tos	~kQuintor says, "I've got nothing to say about Tos, so if you're that curious perhaps you should go and see for ~Iyourself~I."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kQuintor says, "I don't care for the Tos people. They are blind followers, unable to fully think for themselves."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	tos	~kQuintor says, "Tos is at the center of all of the idleness that plagues this land. You probably know more about it than I do."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	whiskey	~kQuintor says testily, "Well, I don't know anything about any no Troll Whiskey."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	whiskey	~kQuintor says, "Get out of my shop."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	widow	~kQuintor says, "Get out of my shop."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	widow qesino	~kQuintor says, "You would do well to avoid rumor-mongering and state your business."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	wife	~kQuintor says, "Are you asking me about my business? Who have you been talking to? I think that you should leave here."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	wife	~kQuintor says, "My wife left these parts years ago, when the mines dried up. I... well, I haven't seen her for some time now."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	wife	~kQuintor says, "That's my business, and none of your affair."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	yevitan	~kQuintor says, "I don't know what you're after, but Yevitan's business is his own, as mine is my own and your business best kept to yourself."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	yevitan	~kQuintor says, "Get out of my shop."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	zhieu b'hob	~kQuintor says, "This is a blacksmith's shop, not a gossip parlor. You will learn to mind your own business in this town."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD		~kQuintor hisses, "Are you stupid? I am asking you to leave."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD		~kQuintor says, "I am too busy to waste another moment on you. Get you gone."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD		~kQuintor says, "You waste my time, beggar. Be on your way."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD		~kQuintor says, "Have you been to Tos, stranger? In Tos there is a grand arena, where Meridians' greatest warriors often test their skills against each other in a trial by combat."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD		~kQuintor says, "If you'll take my advice, don't believe half of what you hear in this town. And watch your step, if you think that the creatures in these hills are treacherous you don't know the half of it until you've gotten yourself on the wrong side of the people of Jasper."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD		~kQuintor says, "My reputation as a weaponsmith speaks for itself. Ask around, the finest sword steel in the land comes out of this forge."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD		~kQuintor says, "There is a different wisdom to the people in these hills than the other peoples of Meridian. You would never get their trust to find it out, but the people of the Cragged Mountains know how to survive. Afiera D'xor is a wise man. Go and see him, stranger."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD		~kQuintor says, "I heard from a traveler recently that a new Queen Spider is active in the Twisted Woods. An adventurer I knew once went after her eggs, on account of the price of those things. She never made it out, though, and the story ends there."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD		~kQuintor says, "The people of Jasper were once completely independent of the rest of Meridian, with our own laws, and government. In the time of my great grandfather we were a separate state, with an appointed Warlord called a Wryn. You can still see the warlord's fortress, The Wryn's Keep, at the edge of town, although now it is rented to outsiders by some businessman in ~IBarloque~I."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD		~kQuintor says, "Someday soon I believe the Wryn's Keep will be returned to its rightful owners, the people of Jasper. Someday very soon that cretin Frular will get his... "
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD		~kQuintor says, "If you want to improve your weapon skills, seek out opponents that are worthy of a good fight. You won't get anywhere fighting opponents that are beneath you."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD		~kQuintor says, "Can I show you anything in particular?"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kQuintor says, "I am in the business of selling metalware. Is there something specific you are wondering about?"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kQuintor says, "You must be new to these parts."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kQuintor says, "You look a little lightly armed to be traveling in these mountains, stranger. Even the idiots in this town know that these hills are perilous, and you won't get any second chances."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kQuintor says, "What do you need?"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kQuintor says, "Are you here about some specific business, stranger?"
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kQuintor says, "Mending a weapon with magic reduces the lifespan of that weapon. Put off mends as long as possible."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kQuintor says, "Better spellcaster will damage your weapons less when they mend them, but mending is very hard on a weapon's overall life."
JasperBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kQuintor says, "Some creatures, like the scorpion, get a taste for your blood in the fight. They will not rest until you either run and hide or until one of you is dead."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	ant	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Goodbye. Come back another time."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	ant	~kAfiera D'xor says, "A gentle creature if avoided completely."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	barloque	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have no use for the place."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	barloque	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I lead a simple life here, with my people and my art."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	barloque	~kAfiera D'xor says, "A beautiful city, though I haven't been there for some years."
JasperElder		Brax	~kAfiera D'xor says, "We have much to learn from the mistakes of the past.  Brax was a terrible mistake, but what have we learned?"
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	bye	~kAfiera D'xor seems to have forgotten that you are here at all.
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	bye	~kAfiera D'xor says, "You must come back and see me soon."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	bye	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yes, goodbye."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	centipede	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Take some responsibility and go find out for yourself."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	centipede	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Simple creatures."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	cor NOTH	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Is that where you've come from?"
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	cor NOTH	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Lovely place, if I remember correctly."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	cor NOTH	~kAfiera D'xor says, "As far as a construct of this civilization goes, it's not a bad one."
JasperElder		council	~kAfiera D'xor says, "A bunch of pretty smart people. But so are goat thieves, bartenders, and street urchins."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	dement	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Come back another time and we shall talk. I cannot help you now."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	dement	~kAfiera D'xor says, "In truth there is but one pool of magic, which is drawn upon from every side, simple. Once you understand that, it is not overly difficult to disrupt those connections by simply disrupting that pool. Splash around a bit... "
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kAfiera D'xor says, "He makes a fine politician, but would he truly make a good king?"
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Those who wish to follow such a pretender both strengthen his resolve to pursue the crown and validate his claim to it."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Politicians come and then pass as the seasons pass. Who is the Duke but a man among his fellow citizens?"
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	faren	~kAfiera D'xor says, "You must leave now. Our conversation is over for today."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	faren	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Faren is the closest deity to the source of all power, and he is on the rise. I know this. Beneath all lies chaos, and beneath chaos, Faren. That is all that I will say."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	faren	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have spent a large portion of my life studying the ways of this world, of the natural orders, and have learned some small and overall meaningless tricks to help me survive. Many attribute the mastery of these tricks to Faren, and Faren magic, but I know better, do you understand? There is but one magic. Only one, from which all sources are drawn."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	hello	~kAfiera D'xor doesn't seem to have noticed that you are even here.
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	hello	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Come in, %NAME."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yes? Who is it? Step closer so that I might see you."
JasperElder		hunter 	~kAfiera D'xor says, "They are little better than the Necromancers, if you ask me."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	jala	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I am tired now. Please go."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	jala	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Jala's true secret has yet to unfold. I have spent my life in thought and meditation over the fate of the Jala, and the fates of art and of music... I can tell you with confidence that Jala is not dead. I cannot pretend to know where she is, for she is the most mysterious and elusive of our deities... but I can tell you that she has shown me that will return when the time is right."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jala	~kAfiera D'xor says, "If you are going to study the ways of the earth along the path of a god, then you must look carefully at all of the gods, for all are equally necessary to complete the design. Do not forget Jala, whom many say is dead. How can art be dead? Music? Do not believe half of this talk. Look around, tell me what's true."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	jasper	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Well, what do you think? Go out there and look around, you are capable of coming to your own conclusions."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Here you have it."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jasper	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Look around for yourself."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	jonas	~kAfiera D'xor says, "He's probably in the bar talking grand strategy, go find him and ask."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	jonas	~kAfiera D'xor says, "A good man at heart, if a little too determined, but he would make a sound ruler, if he can just get past his need for vengeance that is."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jonas	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Have you two been introduced?"
JasperElder		Lich	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Eventually there will come a point when we will have to deal with the Lich in battle.  The time is now to find out about your enemy."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	lighting	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I don't have time for this now."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	lighting	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Conjuring an attack of lightning is a power that I learned from the many years that I spent among the tree folk. I am not adverse to passing it on to those with a capacity to understand, and to utilize the power for what it is."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	marion	~kAfiera D'xor seems to be thinking of something else.
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have not been to Marion in a very long time."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	marion	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Tell me, what is it like these days, Marion?"
JasperElder		Necromancer	~kAfiera D'xor says, "The pendant is a point of power for the necromancer.  It is also a point of vulnerability.  Understand this and perhaps they can be overcome. Make no mistake, they intend to overcome us."
JasperElder		Necromancer 	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Destroy them at all costs."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	orc	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Leave me now."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	orc	~kAfiera D'xor says, "An ancient and venerable civilization, completely misunderstood by our limited end/means sensibilities. But they have also perpetuated these myths. I fear we shall never find the truth, which is not that the orcs are bad and we are good, or right, but that we are scared to death that our world will become something new tomorrow. Even though it must."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Take your questions to her then."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Ho hum."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yes, I spoke with her once, a very long time ago. I don't doubt that she has honorable intentions, but I don't think that she has the will for the undertaking of leadership."
JasperElder		pupil	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Forgive me, but I have no time for a pupil right now. You must leave."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	rat	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Rat?"
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	rat	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Rats are in conflict with us humans essentially because we are both scavengers, competing for the same limited piles of garbage and waste."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	spider	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I cannot talk any more now. Please leave me."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	spider	~kAfiera D'xor says, "The spiders have their own purpose. Can you really blame them for the appearance of hostility when to them you look like a walking meat pie? They are great hunters."
JasperElder		sword of the hunt	~kAfiera D'xor says, "It is a tool of death.  Let us hope these Hunters have at least a shred of moral fiber."
JasperElder		Tendrath	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I wish the poor man had achieved his goal all those years ago.  Then we would not have to deal with these tribulations today."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	tos	~kAfiera D'xor says, "The very center of nonsense in this place."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yes, Tos."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	tos	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Tos? I'm afraid I don't know very much about the city itself."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	tree folk	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I will not speak with you any further today, I must return to my work."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	tree folk	~kAfiera D'xor says, "The tree folk have been upon this land for many millennium, and have discovered ways to maintain peace and to pass existence by their own terms."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	troll	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I don't have anything to say to you at all."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	troll	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Do you know anyone who has ever spoken with a troll? It isn't likely. Not that they are what we would really consider to be interesting conversationalists, sitting here, the two of us. They aren't, by our standards, particularly quick, or keen. The point is that we don't even try, even those that purport to identify with Shal'ille and the ways of healing are all too ready to fight rather then trying to understand. We don't want to hear their answers, so we don't even bother to speak to them at all."
JasperElder		Venya'cyr	~kAfiera D'xor says, "What of her?"
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD	yeti	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yeti? Forgive me, but my concentration is elsewhere. You must leave now."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD	yeti	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I believe that the yeti is the both guardian and messenger. But what message? They are solitary creatures."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "I believe that our conversation is over for now. Come and see me another time."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "People are basically stupid."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Go out there and fight for your living, if that's what you must do. It's easier than thinking, right?"
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Please leave me now. I must return to my carving."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have nothing else to share with you now."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "I must get back to my work now."
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "What do you understand?"
JasperElder	MOOD_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "You can see yourself out."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Old Alzahakar is a wise man. A great magician, and a learned man of many, many books. Perhaps he can help you find a way into your own secret reserves. There is potential that resides within, which even now is waiting for the winter surrounding you to retreat."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Jala is not dead unless she is forgotten completely. She is not dead as long as we keep her alive."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Enjoy yourself."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Be who you want to be. This, all of this, is just a game. Just a game. It's as important as you want it to be."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Find your place and go there. Take your time, and think about what is happening in your life. It is really quite simple."
JasperElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Do you smell something funny?"
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "The treefolk have an old saying for those that speak the tongue. They say "Today is the forest fire, and tomorrow the ashes." They lived only in nightmares, and visions. So there will be a time when all of this passes too, and of our dreams now will then replace this dream, and on, and on."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Be wary in choosing your enemies when the chances to pick them for yourself are afforded. If the choice is never there, then make sure whatever enemies you have don't forget you until they are dead."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have never had any money, nor any interest in the stuff. There are too many I know that follow money above all else, convinced that just to have a little more will truly save them, once and for all... "
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "It is often better to avoid trouble as it approaches. Step around it, let it pass. That is the wisdom of an old man, but one who continues to live and to get older."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "You could devote your life to studying the tokens. Many have. You could also devote your life to chasing your own tail, so to speak. It is a mistake to believe that we can understand something just through learned observation, without delving into the pattern behind it, the grand pattern. Imagination. Meaning."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "It isn't as though we have a choice about art, or music. It is just as much a part of our existence as speaking and listening are."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "You have come a long way to be here, I can see that."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "You can go wherever you wish by fighting your way in, or if you are clever enough you can get to the same places by avoiding violence and stepping around trouble. There are innumerable ways to achieve exactly what you want in this world, my friend."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Don't sweat over the little things... inconveniences, petty slights. There is real tragedy and heartache enough to go around."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Do you know that the orc have a culture that predates our own by a thousand years? I have seen some of the artistic achievements of their people, and count myself fortunate for the insight. For all the outward signs of hostility and apparent ignorance to our own realities, the orc tribes have a cultural sophistication that we same incapable of comprehending,"
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Blessed be Shal'ille, who is gentle and compassionate."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "All hail Jala, our lady of art, of song, and of truth."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Honor Faren, who finds a pattern in the chaos of this world."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Welcome Riija, who honors us with remembrance and vision."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Behold Mighty Kraanan, admirable in his strength and his furious action."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Praise to Qor, who seeks undoing."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Who are you?"
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "What do you seek?"
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "History does not repeat itself, historians tend to repeat each other."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "The music of the earth is a source of magic in and of itself."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "There are secrets beyond the ocean, beyond the mountains, beyond our settlement towns and cities certainly. Secrets that uncover themselves in time, and time."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "You came here to see an old man, and now you have seen me. Why don't you make yourself comfortable there while I work. I will tell you what I can."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "The so-called tokens are relics from a bygone era, from an intelligence that passed over this land so many generations before we came here to dream that nothing remains of them but souvenirs, trinkets beyond our imaginations."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Did you know that the trolls have a heritage all of their own, a history that is both rich and exclusive of ours as our history is exclusive of them?"
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "There are no easy answers."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Life is in the process of happening all around you, right? What are you waiting for?"
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Stay. Rest. We shall talk by and by."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Look around and you'll find your own way. You have time, if you wish to."
JasperElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAfiera D'xor says, "The dead rise in Tos because we will it so, you see, most of our perceived enemies are thus... inventions, fancies of the collective imagination."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "They say that the King has been gone from his throne these many years, and that many calamities have befallen the land because of this. What nonsense! This world follows its' own indescribable path, and nothing may alter that. Kings and Queens are the personification of our vanity, no more."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "It is not enough to create, we must create with risks. From great conflicts come the most powerful surges of creativity, and people aren't happy unless they're miserable. Do you follow me?"
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "There is no right and wrong among the gods. All are equal, all are necessary. Honor their purpose, all."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "The Living Tree, being a magical creature, sets its own rules for survival in many cases. A truce spell can take no hold upon them."
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "Maleval the Sorcerer has progressed his magic beyond the scope of what has yet been imagined. He is playing with the proverbial fire! He has told me that he can teach his sporeburst spell to a student of Qor who is ready to take that step toward Faren!"
JasperElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have heard talk that a single Yrx'l Tree has been identified upon Konima's Island. Having seen the branches and leaves myself, I suspect that that is indeed what it is, although I know the tree only from legend."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Those councilors are trying to reopen the ancient Nexus with the tokens. I'm not so sure that's a good idea. Who knows what will happen when those tokens are brought together? They ought to be ready to call the attention of the gods "
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	afiera d'xor	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, he is a longtime resident of Jasper."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	assassin	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "An ~Iassassin~I? Who was assassinated?"
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	barloque	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I know that Barloque is the home of Meridians' royal family. Our own Yevitan, at the Royal Bank here in Jasper, was a close advisor the King Zarcos IV and lived there for many years before he came back to Jasper."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	barloque	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Although I have yet to travel to Barloque, it is sure to be very grand."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	bye	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Oh, no, you mustn't leave now... it isn't safe to travel the mountains at night."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	bye	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Good %DAYNIGHT to you."
JasperInnKeeper		chicken soup	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I'm fresh out of chicken soup. Would you care for a bowl of faroni stew?"
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	cor NOTH	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Cor Noth is due north and on the plains. They are very idealistic people there."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	cor NOTH	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I'm afraid I've never been to Cor Noth. I'm sure it is a very decent place."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	council	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "They are very wise, I know that, but what can they do for all these troubles? People need to take more on themselves, take control of their own lives."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	council	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "The politics of the council are far removed from the simple life we lead in Jasper."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "That whelp thought he had his hold on us didn't he. He found out the hard way that he was dead wrong."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I shed no tears for Kalior."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kThe Widow Qesino snorts, "I’m sure we’re just an after-thought to him, if he thinks of us at all."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	hello	~kThe Widow Qesino smiles at you warmly.
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Welcome."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Come in and warm yourself near the fire."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	husband	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "My husband disappeared some time ago. He has been missing these many months, and they told me he was presumed dead when they gave up the search."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	husband	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I am a widow."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "This town will make a name for itself yet.  Now that we have Jonas and his rebels here they can't just ignore us any longer."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jasper	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "The talk is really picking up here. I wonder if there will be action behind those words."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	jonas	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "He’s a good man at heart, almost fits in with us mountain folk."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jonas	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I'm not really sure if he is our salvation or latest downfall, it's a tossup really."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	kill	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Who got ~Ikilled~I?"
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "My sister and her husband settled in Marion after the mines closed. It is a lovely town. The people there are very witty, yes, always making jokes."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	marion	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Marion is just out of the mountains, on the other side of the great forest of Farol. Yes, some of the farmers from those parts come up to Jasper regularly to sell their goods at market."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	murder	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Murder? Someone was ~Imurdered~I?"
JasperInnKeeper		need a courier?	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I've already sent out all my correspondences for the day."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	orc	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, the orcs cause many problems for those who must travel in these mountains."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	pietro	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, Pietro... well, he has a little problem with his drinking."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	pietro	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "He runs the tavern. He should still be open, you'll find it just up the street."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Can’t much see her highness hiking up her skirts and strolling through the mountains to Jasper."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Bless her heart, she is left to look after the throne when the land is in such a ~Imess~I, from what I understand. Goes to show you that happiness does not come with great wealth and power."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "She seems very kind, naive, but kind."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	quintor	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, he is a boarder here and he runs the blacksmith shop just across the way. A very fine blacksmith too, as you can see for yourself, he has made many of the things here at the inn."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	quintor	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, Quintor is the blacksmith in Jasper. His shop is just across the way, if you need any metalwork."
JasperInnKeeper		rebels	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "It’s about time Jasper had a regular militia, specially with all them city folk wandering about as of late."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yevitan at the Royal Bank here in Jasper used to work closely with another bank, which is in Tos. You can do business with either one. My late husband didn't trust Yevitan, and would make the trip to Tos just to conduct business. He... well, when he left here for Tos the last time, he went missing. Never showed up in Tos, and no one has seen him here."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	tos	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, it's a big city north of here some distance. My late husband frequently traveled there on business."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	troll	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Trolls are ~Ivery~I wicked."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	yevitan	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "He is a very clever businessman, he was once a close advisor to the King on such matters. That is quite an accomplishment for someone from Jasper, because we are looked down upon by the people from other towns."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	yevitan	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, that is the banker in Jasper. An honest man."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	zhieu b'hob	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Do you know him?"
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I want you to leave my inn."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "You must leave here."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "You won't have much trouble with the rats and the baby spiders you will see in these parts, but be very careful of the trolls and the orcs!"
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "There now, don't you feel better for havin' eaten?"
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Bless you."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I can make you something to eat if you are hungry. "
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "When you need to rest and get your strength back, go to an inn. You are safe here."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Are you sure that you're not hungry? I've just done the shopping, and you look as though you could use a good meal."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "You look as though you've come a long way. I'm sure that Jasper must seem quite backwards to you."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Are you warming up? Let me stoke the fire a bit."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "You'll catch a chill in these mountains at night."
JasperInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Can I get you anything?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	afiera d'xor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "He has a place here in town, and spends most of his time working there now, although as you probably already know he spent his life in solitude in these mountains, out with the beasts, and the gods, do you know what I mean? He is alone, and that's what he's chosen. To dedicate his life to art, and to Jala... er, I mean Faren, you know, and all the other gods too, because you can't really take just one and holds those beliefs sacred above all others, you need to study how all of their ways are necessary. He taught me that, Afiera D'xor did."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	afiera d'xor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "He is absolutely the oldest and wisest man in Jasper, and he is our treasure. Like the crown of Jasper, I suppose, or the secret. Like when you want to keep a secret so badly, I mean so  badly as though it were the most important thin"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	afiera d'xor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "He is an old and venerable part of our community."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	barloque	~kZhieu B'hob says, "That's the Royal City, and it's kind of like a royal enclave or something, because I'll tell you what, I'd say that just about everybody there is for the Princess and for good King Zarcos V. And when the lines get drawn for the final time about who supports who around here, that's where the next Royal Army will march from. Yes %SIRMADAM, that is where it will all begin."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	barloque	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I was really impressed with Barloque when I was there, oh I guess a couple of years ago now. It is hard to ~Iimagine~I a more dignified city. And grand. Oh, ~II know~I, you would have thought that all the stories about Barloque being the Royal City Of Meridian and all would have painted a pretty complete picture and all for me ~Ibefore~I I even got there, but I'll tell you what, I was surprised all the same. The ocean? Well, Barloque's know for being on the ocean, and if you're like me and never ~Iseen~I something like that then the first thing that you realize is that water ~Istarts~I at the edge of the ocean there and then it just ~Igoes~I on and on like that to the edge of the world or who knows where, but just water as far as a man can see. No stopping it. Whoosh. Just like that. Do you ~Iknow~I what I mean?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	barloque	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Barloque is on the other side of Meridian, on the northern coast of the Great Ocean."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	bye	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Good bye."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	bye	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Goodbye, %NAME. Do come back soon."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	bye	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Thank you for stopping in, %SIRMADAM."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	cor NOTH	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I have heard that there is another entrance to the ancient sewer system in Cor Noth, and that by entering there a person could travel ~Icompletely~I underground and come out either here in Jasper, or in Barloque."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	cor NOTH	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Have I told you about the vacation my wife and I took shortly after our wedding? Well, Cor Noth is one of the cities that we visited. I'm here to tell you, talk about the country mouse visiting the city mouse! Cor Noth has some of the nicest folks, but talk? Why those people just love to talk, and about ideas that I just never thought about, let alone discussed! You bet it's a funny city alright, and more friendly than you can imagine! But not at all like Jasper, mostly on account, I'd say, of all the talk. And the things that you'd see in the shops, and such; well we'd never really see those types of things here in Jasper at all unless a stranger came through with them, you know, as personal property or whatnot. But here I am going on and on about Cor Noth when you've probably been there a million times. Have you ever been there yourself, been to Cor Noth?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	cor NOTH	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I don't get down to Cor Noth as often as I would like. It is a fine city. Are you from there?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	council	~kZhieu B'hob says, "A bunch of hocus pocus. Who are the council? Do you know? Hey, I'm all for the idea, let's have some guidance. But where's the leadership to go along with it? I'll tell you where, right here in Jasper, and I probably shouldn't be saying anything at all about this, but you should know... the leadership is right here in Jasper, that's where. Yevitan. And I'll say no more. Just Yevitan. He may not be the next King or Queen of Meridian, but he will be the guy who picks them. Why, even now he is putting together... well, never mind that, just know that Yevitan will be at the center of great change in Meridian."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	council	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Council? Oh, the council! Well for a minute there I really didn't know what you were talking about, the council. What do you want to know about the council, what can I tell you? They are the body of our wisest elders, appointed by the"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	council	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I don't know much about council politics, except to say that they don't bear much weight in Jasper. No %SIRMADAM, like a fly on plate mail."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Looks like Kalior's time came... "
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Duke Akardius is not a man to take lightly. That's all I'm going to say on it. Oh, and that he is very good at what he does. You know, it isn't so easy to be a politician, that's what I'd bet. Always making up the truth, you could get real busy having to do that for a living. Sure could."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I am sure that Akardius is as good at weaving lies as his late uncle."
JasperMerchant		goat	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Did I tell you about my pet goat? His name is Aythya, you might see him floating around here sometimes."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	hello	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Good day."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	hello	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Hello, %NAME. Come in, what can I do for you?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Good day to you, %SIRMADAM. What can I do for you today?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well, I could tell you plenty about Jasper, how much time have you got? Ha ha ha, but really, it's a good town. Full of opportunity, that's what my wife has always said, and where at first I didn't really see so much what she meant, I see it a lot more now. There is plenty of opportunity here, if you can get inside with the locals, and if you have determination. Take me for example, I make a pretty good living, enough to get by, and the goods that I keep in my shop are among the best that you can find anywhere."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	jasper	~kZhieu B'hob says, "The people of Jasper aren't so hard to understand as some folks let on, just a bit reserved, you know, the silent types. We have sort of a motto here in Jasper, and I think that we do well by it: ~IDon't say nothing at all if you don't have something nice to say~I. Those are words to live by whether here in Jasper, or wherever you take your boots off at the end of the day."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NOT_BAD	jasper	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Before the mines closed down this place was booming. You should have seen Jasper then, I don't think you'd even recognize it. Now it's more like it was in those days, with Jonas setting up his headquarters here and all. I knew that Jasper would once again have its day."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	marion	~kZhieu B'hob says, "A sanctuary dedicated to Shal'ille has been set up in Marion, where I understand any in need are welcomed and cared for. Started by some Lady from Barloque, a genuine Lady now, in the royal sense, not just a ~Ilady~I lady %NAME. I have heard that when her husband passed on quite recently, a Lord Aftyn, he left her a considerable fortune and she decided to turn that money into helping people who need it the most! Can you imagine? I hear also that her children, now grown, are quite upset by it too. Poor things. All old enough to take care of themselves too, I hear, but the story goes that they were counting on that money and now they are turned to their own devices! HA! Serves them right!"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I have a cousin ran off to Marion, she married a man down there who raises apples, you know, has an orchard and they picked the apples and sold them to a caravan or something. Both of them into Faren. Well, he up and left one day, too"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	marion	~kZhieu B'hob says, "It's mostly a farming town, and we have quite a bit of trade with them. I get down there a couple of times a year."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	pietro	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well, stupid is as stupid does I always say. I mean, a little control is in order, because that's no way to run a business. And when he drinks, he talks, and he talks about peoples' business that he's got no say in, whatsoever. He better learn to watch his tongue, is all I'm saying, before some gets around to carving it out of his head for him."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	pietro	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well, Pietro has a little problem with his drinking. You'd think that a grown man would know when to stop...  I mean, I've got nothing whatsoever against drinking, but I don't feel it would be right to send you over there without some sort of preparation, because it can be a little shocking, the state that he gets himself into. All worked up, and you know the Troll Whiskey doesn't help him either."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	pietro	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Yes, Pietro. Well he's a local man here, runs the bar just down the street there. But I'll tell you frankly %SIRMADAM, you'd only want to go in there if you are ~Ireally~I thirsty."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kZhieu B'hob says, "You might talk with Yevitan about the Princess. He was once... acquainted with the King, and close to the royal family."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kZhieu B'hob says, "You know, my wife and I have been talking about it and we've decided; we cannot wait for the Princess to have her inauguration and just become the Queen. Can you wait? Well, neither of us can, that's for sure. It's my personal opinion"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Oh, yes, the Princess. Well, she certainly seems to be a ~Icapable~I young woman, hardly more than a girl and with all this responsibility! Can you imagine?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	quintor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "There was a time, when the mines were still in operation, that Quintor had such a lovely young wife, a local girl. Well, saddest thing, but when the mines closed, I guess his young wife just figured that maybe she would clear out of here with the rest of them, she broke her vows and packed it up with on of the mining company officers and she was gone. Now Quintor, he went into such a rage, such a rage... I was only a child at the time, but I'll never forget it."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	quintor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "He's the quiet type, but you know what the say about still rivers running deep. There's a lot more going on there than either you or I would care to imagine. But he's a good businessman, and an excellent craftsman, and what more needs to be said, really? Don't you think that that's enough for one man?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	quintor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "A very fine blacksmith, you can take my word on that or you can go and see for yourself. He's just down the street."
JasperMerchant		tos	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I don't really know much about ~ITos~I, I go down there for business from time to time... not the kind of place I'd go for vacation, I'll say that."
JasperMerchant		tova	~kZhieu B'hob says, "What a cut-up."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	whiskey	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Troll Whiskey is a traditional brew of the people in these hills, and it's some kind of powerful drinking. Boom, like that, blow the top of your head right into the night sky. Not that I would know, you understand, it is illegal. In the days when Jasper was a separate mountain kingdom, the armies of the great Jasper Overlords would drink Troll Whiskey before the would go into battle, and they were undefeatable. Unstoppable. Many say beyond this world, immortals on the battlefield. That's why it became outlawed, when the Jasper people were finally conquered at the Battle of Denthan Crossing, the King then Zarcos II decreed that Troll Whiskey would thereafter be forbidden, to produce or consume."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	whiskey	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Troll Whiskey is a traditional potion made by the Jasper people, some say magic, some say Qor-badness. But either way, it's illegal, and has been now for some time. They'll hang you for making it, the Duke's people... "
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	whiskey	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Troll Whiskey? Boy oh boy, you're better off not knowing anything at all about Troll Whiskey. Let's just leave it at that."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	widow qesino	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well, perhaps her husband wasn't the easiest man to get along with, I mean, that was just kind of accepted around here, and Faren knows I didn't have to live with the man... but I have to say that it was odd, you know, at the funeral... I ~Iwatched~I her at that funeral, not to be rude or anything, but I was ~Iconcerned~I at the time... and I swear to you, she didn't shed a single tear. Now even for the Jasper people, who are never very outward with their emotions, I have to say that it was a ~Ibit~I odd... "
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	widow qesino	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I knew old man Qesino pretty well, before he disappeared. Not to speak poorly of the dead, but he was an ornery, unpleasant man. Always thought someone was trying to cheat him out of something. Didn't really make any attempt to temper himself, you know, get along with people. Even in Jasper you need a few niceties... makes things so much easier, you know what I mean?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	widow qesino	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Tragic, just tragic. Her husband disappearing and all."
JasperMerchant		wool	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I don't think I've told you about Jasper wool, have I? Well, Jasper produces the finest wool in the land, hands down. There is no better wool anywhere. It's our goats, and the skill of our weavers. I've got some pants here, if you're interested, I can show you exactly what I mean... "
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	wryn's keep	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Nowadays The Wryn's Keep is occupied by strangers, people not from the mountains at all, but they've rented it from Frular of Barloque. That upsets a few of the people here, but not me. I say business is business."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	wryn's keep	~kZhieu B'hob says, "The Wryn's Keep is the traditional fortress of the old Jasper Overlords, did you know that?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	wryn's keep	~kZhieu B'hob says, "It's that big castle on the outskirts of the town here. You can see it from the outside, but you have to be a guest of the guild that has it rented to get inside. Can you imagine anything more insulting to the people of Jasper? I mean, excuse me if you are one of those that are part of that guild, you certainly seem like a nice enough %LORDLADY, but I can't help getting a little fired up about this. The Wryn's Keep belongs to the people of Jasper, and that's how it should stay. Ours. Not some Frular-Of-Barloque-Businessman Type."
JasperMerchant		yes	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well then you know all about it then."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD	yevitan	~kZhieu B'hob says, "A good man to have on your side, Yevitan is. He is always watching out for the people of Jasper. Yevitan... well, I guess you might say he's a patriot. A true patriot, he has so much to offer this land, so many ideas about what our future could be, and now that we have the proper leadership..."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	yevitan	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Don't judge a book by its cover they say, and I guess that applies just so to Yevitan, like a hand might fit right into a glove, or an old shoe, something like that because he is one smart guy. Oh, I don't mean just because he was the King's own Financial Minister specifically, although you know that  in itself is a huge accomplishment, of course, coming from Jasper and all, but I mean he is smart. He's got a lot figured out, you know, sometimes I swear that he can predict the future, that's how smart he is. Oh, I couldn't really give you any examples, you'll have to talk to him yourself and see what you think, because I really couldn't give you any solid examples, but you go and talk to him and I guarantee that you'll see exactly what I mean."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL	yevitan	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Oh, yes, Yevitan... he is the banker here at the Royal Bank. Yevitan paid his dues and bought the bank away from Duke Akardius. He is a very good banker, very trustworthy."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD	zig	~kZhieu B'hob says, "We are very mindful of the secret police and the Duke's spies up here in the mountains, %NAME. I'll say no more of it, for nothing but trouble comes from that talk."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "If you go to Marion %NAME you have to go in the Limping Toad and have an ale with the proprietor, Tova. He is a funny, funny man."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Not too difficult to lose your way in these mountains and just disappear, really, happens to people who've spent their whole lives up here. Take Qesino, for instance, I mean whatever happened to him, he might as well have dropped off the face of the earth. And I'm sure he'd made that trip from here to Tos a thousand times with his money for the bank there, you know, he and Yevitan here had a falling out years back and neither of them ever got past that point, and he always took his money all the way to Tos to deposit, wouldn't set foot in the Royal Bank here to save his own life. Knock on wood."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Did you know that Jasper was once the very heart of an independent mountain kingdom in Meridian? We had our own government and laws, and our own Overlord who sat upon a throne in The Wryn's Keep. But that was many ages ago, in the time of my grandfather's grandfather.  Although with Jonas taking over his own little faction it might become that way again some day soon."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Did you know that our own Yevitan, the banker here in Jasper, was once the Financial Minister under King Zarcos V? That's right, and that's no small accomplishment either, being a man from Jasper and all, because you rarely see a man or woman from Jasper that is allowed into those circles at all."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "You've no doubt heard that the King is in hiding, you know supposedly he had some kind of supposed mental failure, or whatever, and then he had to go into hiding to protect his well being. Okay, well everyone knows that. But do you know where he is? Well, I wouldn't be able to say that I know, but I have it on the highest authority that he is safe, and very nearby. I probably shouldn't sat anything about this at all, but I hear he's in Marion. Marion. I don't know where exactly, but Marion is what I hear."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Oh, what's the use, %NAME? What is the use?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_BAD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "This is the place."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Have you ever seen a so-called magic wand? A man I know, Fehr'loi Qan buys them and says he has a large collection up in Barloque. He told me he keeps them at his blacksmith shop. He won't say much more than that, though, he is a very quiet type. He used to live in Tos, and I would see him every couple of months when I was there on business, you know, we'd get together and play chess. But... he took his business moved north to Barloque, and I'll tell you what, it was probably the best thing he ever did, from a business standpoint anyway. Oh yes, he is making the shillings now! He'll probably be able to retire in a couple of years! Can you imagine? Retire in Barloque? And a relatively young guy too. I tell you what, he has it made."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "The guilds seem to offer a certain amount of protection to their members... and you know what? I'm starting to think that maybe we should form a merchant guild. That's right, a merchant guild, one that protects us merchants, what do you think about that? That's what we need alright. See, that way we could meet every so often decide issues, you know, the Big Issues. Like... okay, like what are our policies about prices? Or who do we serve, you know, where do we stand politically? Duke? Hmmm? Princess?  Jonas?  Is that the answer? I think that it would do us a lot of good to form a guild, that's right, get some of these issues out on the table and hammer them out, so to speak. I'd be willing to surrender some of my personal beliefs, if that's what it would take."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "I say a prayer every day that the Princess is safe, but I can see how Jonas would make an excellent and prosperous King.  This political strife and fighting needs to end forever.  So that there will be justice, and peace, and that the orcs go way back into the mountains, and mind their own business back there forever. Because I think we need to have that kind of stability that a monarch provides, someone for everyone to look up to and admire, someone to have the final say on anything that comes up."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "How are you stocked up there for provisions? You know it's a mistake that a lot of people traveling in these hills make, is to not bring enough provisions along with them, because food will give you the energy that you need to survive out there. I know that the edge of survival can be that fine. My wife lost her brother to the mountains in just such a way. So take a look at what I've got here, and fill up your knapsack with what you have room for, you'll thank me for it later. You'll certainly thank me the next time that you're in my shop %NAME. And you'll thank me out there in the mountains."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Now don't go out into those mountains without dressing warmly enough, or you won't last longer than spit in the griddle. Take it from me, I've been up here my whole life. Now let me show you what I've got here, made from pure Jasper w"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "What's your opinion on the Justicar system? Yeah, well personally, I'll tell you what something needs to be done, with the King out of sight and who knows who coming and going from power! I'm glad, personally speaking now, that we people have some say in how criminals are dealt with! We can't wait for the Duke to get off his rear, no sir. None too soon, I say."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Actually, the people in this town can be downright rude, if you're not used to their ways. It's a wonder that anyone stops through Jasper at all. You would think that they would appreciate some meaningful contact with the rest of Meridian... business would certainly pick up, and Faren knows we could all use that... I don't know, %NAME, I've lived here my whole life and I can't figure it out. I guess it's just the way they are up here, I mean everyone is perfectly nice once you get to know them, it's mostly a matter of getting in at all, you know? Say for instance, how do you even start a conversation with Afiera D'xor if you're not from here? Hey, I've known him my whole life, he's practically a brother to my uncle and I can see how it would be hard. Believe me, I can see that %NAME."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "The problems of the working class are too often overlooked here, I mean who is looking out for the little guy in this land? Not the Duke, I'll tell you that much, and the Princess, well, I'm not sure that she has the experience yet that she'll need to become Queen. Someday soon, mind you, but not yet. You know what I mean. But those of us who are struggling just to keep bread on the table, make ends meet? Where do we turn in the face of all these troubles? Can you tell me that? Not likely, but I can. Jonas knows what it is liked to be shunned, he knows what it is like to have to work for every little bit that you have. To my mind that combination makes a better ruler than someone who never gets out into the world."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_GOOD		~kZhieu B'hob says, "You know %SIRMADAM, just this morning I was sweeping up here and thinking to myself how nice it would be to just close up my shop for a couple of days and just wander around a little, you know, maybe go down to Cor Noth, do a little shopping, something like that. I'll bet that's exactly what you do, move around a lot, am I right? It must be nice sometimes, although don't get me wrong I am grateful for what I have, still sometimes, you know, I wonder... "
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "A shilling saved is a shilling earned, you know what I mean? You're better off not carrying around too much cash, go and see Yevitan at the bank up the street. He'll keep your money safe, and you'll be able to make deposits and withdrawals from the Bank in Tos as well! Isn't that a good deal?"
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Just the basics in this town, %SIRMADAM. We'll get you what you need alright, just as long as it fits into the basic category."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "There's been quite a bit of activity between the guilds of late... not all of it good, either, in fact I'd say that most of it has been mischievous and that's no good, there's no place for people just behaving however they like, for Faren's sake."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "As my granny always said, a stitch in time saves nine! You'd best stock up on your necessary provisions here, stranger, the mountains can be unforgiving."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "The other people of Meridian tend to see us Jasper folk as being... odd types, I guess, you know, somehow different. You get a lot of that."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "We've got a real nice inn here in Jasper, run by Qes... err, the Widow Qesino, and she does a great job. Good food too. Uh, yep... great food. Real warm inside too. Nice inn."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Jasper is renown for, among other things, our fine woolen products. You can't get pants like the kind I sell here anywhere else in the world."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "I've seen you in here before, %NAME, I'd swear on it. I never forget a face."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "You'll find that the prices are probably a bit higher up here in the mountains, but that's because we're pretty isolated up here. It's worth it though, %SIRMADAM, the quality of our goods is unparalleled."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Did you see the blacksmiths' shop just up the street?  Yes?  Well, Quintor may come off as being a bit stern at first, but he's a fine blacksmith. No, not what you'd call a conversationalist, but his weapons are recognized throughout the world as being the finest anywhere. Swords especially."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "Can I interest you in something here? I'm sure we've got something here that you need... "
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "I hope that you don't take it personally if the people of Jasper seem, well, a bit reserved toward you, %SIRMADAM. That is just their way."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "I can sell you all the provisions that you need to get into, out of, and through these mountains, although I can't say safely. That, %SIRMADAM, is up to you. Keep your wits about you, because it's only that or Troll Whiskey that'll get you through."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "There's too much gossip in this town."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kZhieu B'hob says, "There are many fine craftspeople and artists in Jasper. Our products are very valuable in other parts of this kingdom."
JasperMerchant	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~k~kZhieu B'hob says, "People come in here, and want to talk, you know, just pass the time of day and whatnot. Anyway, sometimes I hear gossip and rumors, which naturally I don't repeat because I can't know if they're true or not, and I don't really believe in talking about things that one knows nothing about... but this one is worth repeating even if only because it holds such hope! I have heard rumors, and only rumors now, that although Jala is dead, she lives through her songs! Imagine! Art, and music! Oh, I so want it to be true!"
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	a'ach	~kZala says, "That's what we call war. I call it a big waste."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	army	~kZala says, "They make me laugh!"
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	bong	~kZala says, "Hmmmm... "
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	bud	~kZala says, "Are you trying to get me in trouble?"

KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	goodbye	~kZala says, "Hey, stop back in sometime, okay?"
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	Hello	~kZala says, "Hello, %NAME."
KocatanApothecary		Hello	~kZala ix'Mecya takes a puff from her pipe and says, "Hey, welcome to my shop. Can I get you something?"
KocatanApothecary		help	~kZala ix'Mecya says, "I run this magic shop. If you are in need of herbs or reagents for your mystic rituals, I'm the woman to talk to."
KocatanApothecary		help	~kZala says, "I don't get it."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	Huf Huf Moch	~kZala says, "The Huf Huf Moch? Oh, that's the ko'catanese name for The Barking Monster. Same thing. It's a big bar that the military keeps, just down the hill."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	ixleoc	~kZala says, "You should know what the ixleoc is, because it's from your land. It's that walking dead person thing."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	ko'catan	~kZala says, "Well that's where you are, man."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	Konima	~kZala says, "That's the guy in charge, you know, called that after the original guy in charge. It bums me out that they won't even consider giving a woman that job. Plenty of women around here that would do it just as well or better than some old a'ach guy."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	pekonch	~kZala says, "That's our word for wine. You can get some excellent pekonch here, but watch out for the cheap stuff."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	pot	~kZala says, "I've got these clay pots, but they're not for sale. I use them to store magical reagents."
KocatanApothecary		sell	~kZala says, "Sure, I got some stuff to sell."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD	smoke	~kZala says, "Don't start. It's a nasty habit."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "Whoa, I forgot you were here. Did I help you yet?"
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "You're not from Ko'catan, I can see that now. Can I ask why you traveled all this way?"
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "Riija magic is pretty interesting. I don't know if you've messed around with it much, but it's best to be careful how much time you spend at it. People go crazy from Riija, you'll see them around."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "That's a fantastic shirt."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "What's up with the weather? It's been so hard to come to work lately."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala looks around and says, "Whoa, check it out."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala coughs loudly, expelling a large cloud of smoke.
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "Kick back if you want; I'm just hanging out."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "The way I see it, the strength of a spell is generally going to depend on just a couple of factors... and that's pretty much the duration, your trance time, and the cost in mana. Oh, and did I say effect powers? Well, the effect powers too."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "You know, it's not like you can just use any old reagents to make a spell. They've got to be flawless, or it just won't work. That especially includes the claws of kriipa, and dragonfly eyeballs."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "I feel like a ixleoc. Brain dead, like that."
KocatanApothecary	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kZala says, "I don't get it. In your Land Across and Beneath the Water, you have the teotkauilkinich, and you have the little imixkinich. So hey, man, are they the same thing? Do they both come from the kokinich mother? Do they hunt from the same web?"
KocatanApothecary			~kZala sorts through a pile of green herbs. She carelessly tosses the dead brown ones to the floor.
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "I hope there are not too many spices in this brew."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala seems to forget you are here and begins to meditate.
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "My mind remains focused, even in haze. I see the fog that clouds the transcendent planes."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "The eggs are fresh today, of course."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala munches on achalot nuts and packs her pipe.
KocatanApothecary			~kZala hums softly as she works on tying herbs into small bunches.
KocatanApothecary			~kThere is a thick fertile smell that permeates the shop from the incense Zala burns.
KocatanApothecary			~kZala absently says, "Mastering the art of mind fog."

KocatanBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kOxal says, "In this society, the only excuse that you have for not being a warrior is to be a dead warrior. Perhaps I would have been more fortunate if a had had my head chopped off by that Avar hatchet rather than my arm. I am but half a warrior."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kOxal says, "I've got plenty to say about the way things are run around here, but talking about change in Ko'catan will get you trouble."

KocatanBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kOxal says, "It isn't easy to be a half-soldier in our society, I have to work twice as hard to fulfill my duty. Without duty a soldier is worthless, and a worthless soldier... well, the jungle is full of shallow holes we dug to put worthless soldiers in."

KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "After I was wounded at Balo na'te Din the War Directorate assigned me to working here at the Huf Huf Moch, on account of my record with the Katalin waz Lal'ca. It is a great honor for a wounded veteran to be assigned here, so close to the Army after he has become useless to war."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "Have you heard of Xacal ko'Ixca? He is the commanding officer of my combat unit, Katalin waz Lal'ca. Although I am no longer on the active roster for my unit, I hold Captain ko'Ixca in the highest regard and honor. Drink to Captain ko'Ixca!!"
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "I understand that in the land across and beneath the water you have many cities as large as Ko'catan and enemies abound, and yet there is no zax'Kicica... that you have no army! How can that be?"
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "The mural up there tells the story from the time of the Waz Waz Konima, our Second Warlord, and The Two-Front War. It was a dark hour when we nearly lost all to the combined Avar'ot Kici'ca, one hundred and fifty-six years before this year. The valor of our atz Kici'ca was tremendous, and we were saved!"
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "When I was with Katalin waz Lal'ca years ago as a Iz'ca before Balo na'te Din, we were on patrol when we came across a remote and fortified trading post far from here in the jungle. A fantastic place to behold. My unit had secretly surrounded the fort and we were preparing to storm it when a message came from Captain ko'Ixca that we were to let the fort be. I heard later that it was a Zax'at that runs this place, one of yours."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "Be careful of the exzor ferns out in the jungle. They'll cut right through your trousers and your boots."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "This settlement would have been annihilated long ago if it were not for our strong emphasis on military and fortification. The rules from the A'ach tezcha may not give us the ideal life here, but we are alive at least."

KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "Welcome, Zax'ta. I am Oxal ix'Tokak, honored by the A'ach tezcha to serve here. What is your bidding?"
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "Can I help you, Zax'ta?"
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal deftly cleans up behind the bar, working at a fluid pace.
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kOxal says, "I have a duty here, to run Huf Huf Moch as efficiently as any unit in the Kici'ca fulfills its duties. I take my orders very seriously."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kOxal says, "My opinion is that the Ix'ca spend far too much time in here during the day. If I were the ranking officer or the Captain of the Day Guard I would keep all the soldiers so busy that they wouldn't have time to drink wine."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kOxal says, "If this military isn't vigilant, those Avar'ot would mount an attack and ravage Ko'catan. We are that close to extinction here."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kOxal says, "This hall has been here for almost two hundred years. It was set up by the Kici'ca, and it is here even now mostly for the Kici'ca. You are here as a guest of the Ko'catani Kici'ca. "
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kOxal says, "I have seen a stranger in here from the Land Across and Under the Water, with a curious half sword. What a weapon! Perfect for one as myself!"
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kOxal says, "If you encounter the avar'ca in the jungle, be most careful. They will attack in waves, with the wounded falling back to heal and rally, and then rejoining the fray."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kOxal says, "The stronger a warrior's arms and armor, the better their ability to resist a magical attack. We learned this early on in the a'ach kici'ca, and it will serve you as well. Always take care of your equipment."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kOxal says, "I have heard that in your Land Across and Beneath the Water, you have spirited trees! These tezmecya must make your jungles very difficult to maneuver indeed."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kOxal says, "If not for the bad luck of losing my arm at Balo na'te Din, I would have been a ranking officer by now."
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kOxal carefully wipes a glass with a colorfully printed towel.
KocatanBartender	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kOxal says, "It has taken us years to eradicate the napyijoa from Ko'catan, but I understand that even the sewers have no trace of the vermin. That is how efficient is our A'ach tezcha."

KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "This anvil has been in my family for six generations. My grandfather's grandfather was the weaponsmith to Konima himself, and was next to him when he passed from this life. The wounds on Konima were so great, that in some places his armor was irreparable. My grandfather's grandfather made this anvil from the breastplate of Konima's great platemail. That's true, every zoszin word of it."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "This land that you come from, across and beneath the water. What the zoszin kazot kind of blacksmiths do you have there? Your tools and your weapons look so zoszin clumsy."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "I really don't give a kazot about the Avars or the Orcs. They got some guys like to fight, we got some guys that like to fight, the two groups of guys get together and fight. It's a minor zoszin sidelight, that's all. Big deal. That's not what life is about. But it keeps the zoszin business good."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla yells, "Chot!" She's a little frustrated with her work right now.
KocatanBlackSmith			~kYou don't see any evidence of wood or other fuel that would normally be needed in great abundance to feed a fire so remarkably hot.

KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "You need to be pretty zoszin careful with a nerudite sword. It's not like that clumsy zoszin iron you're probably used to swinging, nerudite is sharp and refined. But it's also brittle, so it's no good swinging it like a zoszin hammer."

KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "I make different types of arrows."
KocatanBowMaker			~kA slight creaking can be heard from the back room.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla bends an arrow to test the strength of the shaft. When it doesn't break, she seems pleased.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla sings a soft song to herself as she works the wood.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla applies a light coating of oil to the bow in her hands.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "Hail, %NAME."
KocatanCaptainEvil		Balo na'te Din	~kXacal says, "Balo na'te Din? That's a strange thing for you to be asking about."
KocatanCaptainEvil		bribe	~kXacal says, "Bribe is such an ugly word. Let's just say that a ~Igift~I of a thousand shillings buys a little cooperation."
KocatanCaptainEvil		buy	~kXacal says, "I ain't buying."
KocatanCaptainEvil		Hello	~kXacal watches you with apparent amusement.
KocatanCaptainEvil		help	~kXacal says, "I am Xacal ko'Ixca, Captain of the Teot Guard and acting Tezcha Kici'ca in command of the Main Gate. Nothing passes this gate unless I say so."
KocatanCaptainEvil		ko'catan	~kXacal says, "Kazot you, skip the rigmarole."
KocatanCaptainEvil		konima	~kXacal says, "Don't play games with me. This isn't the visitors bureau, and I ask the questions, not you."
KocatanCaptainEvil		reason	~kXacal says, "A thousand shillings is a good reason to break the rules."
KocatanCaptainEvil		restrictions	~kXacal says, "By proclamation of the A'ach tezcha, blah, blah, blah, the following items are restricted; you don't pass with restricted items unless I say so. Ready? Weapons; you can carry two weapons. Armor; you can get away with the armor you're wearing, that's it. Kangi stone; you don't have any kangi stone, zax'ix. Raw nerudite; no raw nerudite will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Got that? Alcohol; any alcohol will be confiscated by the captain on duty. Umacha beans; I don't care about umacha beans. Now, those are the rules, and we don't break the rules around here unless we have good reasons."
KocatanCaptainEvil		sell	~kXacal says, "Anything is available, for the right price."
KocatanCaptainEvil		sing	~kXacal says, "You're kidding me, right? At my gate? Keep it up, you're going to look pretty humorous eating brown corn with no front teeth, ix'chot."
KocatanCaptainEvil		tepal 	~kXacal says, "Ah, I see. Tepal ix'Zonak sent you? Well, you're not in sanctuary now, so play by the rules or you may end up splashed on the floor here trying to breath with your lungs ripped out."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "According to the Tezcha A'ach, we are currently in a heightened state of diplomatic awareness with the Avar. What does that mean? That means that although we are not at war, every night I send out a patrol of mean, quiet guys that come back in the morning washing blood and feathers off their armor and the generals pretend nothing happened. It means that anything that passes this gate only does so if I think there's a good reason. And if it's restricted, it better be a really good reason."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "So what brought you out to our quaint little island? Easy money, right? That's right, easy money. Well, you best watch your little entrepreneurial steps, or young Cital might find you floating face down in that little pool in front of Konima's tomb one morning."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal glances over his shoulder and shares a laugh with the guards.
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "I am ordered to deny passage through this gate of any parties carrying restricted items. And that's exactly what I'm going to do."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal jokes,"Be careful out there, Zax'ta." His men share a hearty laugh.
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "Young Cital commands the gate during the day, and I'm here at night, every night. We do things a little differently, the two of us."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "Don't get cute."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "Look alive there. If you've got business with the gate, then let's deal. Otherwise, I don't give a chot what you're up to, beat it, and fast. I have little patience for foreigners."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal's veteran guards watch you contemptuously.
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "You're going out there to play around a bit, huh? It gets a bit rough out there, you better be ready to play rough."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "You cannot show mercy out in the jungle, for none will be shown to you, zax'ix. If your enemy flees, it will only be because they are close to death. Hit them with your range weapons, or they will be back to attack when their strength returns. That is the law of the jungle."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "Have you heard of the koutom in the tunnels? He is faster than evil itself, I have seen him. Only the most seasoned warrior survives sword-to-sword with that clever moch."
KocatanCaptainGood		bribe	~kCital says, "I hope that you are not attempting to bribe me. Offering graft to a ranking officer in the Kici'ca is an offense punishable by imprisonment and subsequent death."
KocatanCaptainGood		buy	~kCital says, "We are not here to sell anything. At this gate nothing is negotiable, and any attempt to bribe a Ko'catani Officer could lead to your imprisonment. Followed by interrogation, and death."
KocatanCaptainGood		Hello	~kCital says, "Good afternoon, %SIRMADAM."
KocatanCaptainGood		help	~kCital says, "I am Cital ko'Manca, Captain of the Kin Guard and acting Tezcha Kici'ca in command of the Main Gate."
KocatanCaptainGood		ko'catan	~kCital says, "The homeland that I have sworn to defend. Have you heard our national anthem?"
KocatanCaptainGood		koutom	~kCital says, "Koutom is our word for the chieftain of the orcs."
KocatanCaptainGood		restricted items	~kCital quotes, "By proclamation of the A'ach tezcha, the following items are restricted; parties may not pass through this gate with restricted items in their possession. Weapons; parties are limited to two weapons only for their personal defense outside the gate. Armor; parties are limited to one suit of armor for their safety outside the gate. A ~Isuit~I of armor is composed of one of each of the following items- one pair of gauntlets, one shield, one helmet, and one breastplate. Kangi stone; no Kangi stone will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Raw nerudite; no raw nerudite will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Alcohol; no alcoholic beverages will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Umacha beans; no umacha beans will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Is that clear enough?"
KocatanCaptainGood		sell	~kCital says, "This is not a market %SIRMADAM."
KocatanCaptainGood		sing	~kCital sings, "Ko'catan, Ko'catan, yo lal ona tan, tez'ca, tez'ca, hu lal ona tan, yo'ca, yo'ca, tez lal ona tan, Ko'catan, Ko'catan!"
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital ko'Manca is all business.
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "I am ordered to deny passage through this gate of any parties carrying restricted items."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "A word of advice. The jungle is fraught with dangers that you cannot even imagine. When I venture out of this gate, it is with at least twenty veteran soldiers. I suggest that you be very careful out there."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "I sincerely hope that you have enjoyed your stay in Ko'catan."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "What you do outside of these gates is your business, but what you bring out there is mine. I take my business very seriously. That is my duty."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "We are currently in a heightened state of diplomatic awareness with the Avar. That means that although we are not at war, the flow of goods from this gate is restricted."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital glances over his shoulder and the guards snap to attention.
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital eyes you steadily.
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says to his men, "Vapil adiki zax'lal. A mozo ona zax."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital's elite guards watch your every movement.
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "A piece of advice to the unwary. If you notice that the area is darkening, watch for the teotkriipa, or shadowbeast. They are fast and dangerous."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "I will also warn you that good soldiers survive in the jungle by defending their allies. That works on both sides, for you, and your enemies."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "Beware the avar'ca, even though we are supposedly on neutral standing with them. They are territorial, and will not hesitate to attack if they see you as a threat."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "Survival usually depends on knowing your enemy. The primitive avar'ca military doctrine usually dictates that they deploy their ranged weapons away from you, the target, while their infantry moves to engage. The best way to combat this is to send part of your force to flank them, and annihilate the archers and spell casters."
KocatanInnKeeper		Avar	~kMoxal says, "Unfortunately, our culture has had a lot of misunderstandings with the Avars. Once matters are cleared up, they are going to be great culture to take from, I mean, trade with."
KocatanInnKeeper		buy	~kMoxal says, "I'm always interested in a good deal."
KocatanInnKeeper		bye	~kMoxal says, "So long, %NAME! May all of your journeys be profitable."
KocatanInnKeeper		hello	~kMoxal ix'Hanak greets you with, "Hello, %NAME! You're just in time. Any later and you would have missed out on some great deals."
KocatanInnKeeper		Hello	~kMoxal says, "Hail, %NAME!"
KocatanInnKeeper		help	~kMoxal says, "I am here to serve you."
KocatanInnKeeper		ko'catan	~kMoxal says, "This is the greatest society mankind has ever known. But maybe someday I'll leave Ko'catan to see what the old cities have to offer."
KocatanInnKeeper		konima	~kMoxal says, "Konima was the greatest hero and entrepreneur this society has ever known. I wish I was around to get in on his expedition in its start up."
KocatanInnKeeper		Riija	~kMoxal says, "Riija is a fine upstanding god. He doesn't deserve the bad reputation some people give him."
KocatanInnKeeper		sell	~kMoxal says, "I have food here, but I'm sure I can help you better spend your hard earned money."
KocatanInnKeeper		teach	~kMoxal says, "I'm afraid I'm not allowed to teach anything yet."
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kMoxal says to himself, "Where am I going get 450,000 shillings? I am such a dead man. Riija help me, I'm such a dead man."
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kMoxal sweats profusely and says, "Xacal ko'Ixca didn't send you did he? If he did, let him know I ~Ihave~I his money. Well, I mean I will have his money tomorrow."
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kMoxal paces back and forth nervously as if awaiting some disaster.
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kMoxal says to himself, "What am I going to do?! There is no way I can come up with that much money."
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kMoxal wipes tears from his eyes while muttering something about losing a lot of money.
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kMoxal cheerfully smiles at you.
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kMoxal happily sings an old folk song to himself.
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kMoxal smiles and says, "Today is a great day, don't you think?"
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kMoxal counts a large stack of coins, giggling to himself.
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kMoxal says, "So how long have you been in the settlement? You must love it here. I know I do."
KocatanInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kMoxal says, "Business has really started booming since your people started coming here. In fact, I only need a few more masters to sponsor me and I'll move up a rank."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "You know... never mind, I shouldn't say... well, all right, since we're friends. I know of a group of prospectors who have located an emerald mine. The claim hasn't been made official yet, so there is still time to invest in the mining operation. If you give me 12,000 shillings, we can quadruple it in two weeks time."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "I'm thinking of opening a second inn on the mainland. Just imagine, the authentic feel of Ko'catan right in the middle of Cor Noth. Tell you what, since I like you, I'll let you invest 25,000 shillings. With it you would own one quarter of the inn and its profits."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "Have you bet on the warriors Tourney yet? I have inside knowledge that the champion is going to lose. If you want in, the odds pay 67 to 1. Guaranteed win. Give me 500 shillings and I'll place the bet for you."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "Come here. Do you want to make big money? I'm involved in a group where the profits are enormous. Here's how it works, as a new member you pay me 1,000 shillings. Now the next twenty new members pay you 1,000 shillings each. You will be rich in no time."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "Last chance to enter the raffle for the nerudite bow! Only 500 shillings to enter. Winner announced tomorrow."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "How much money do you have on you? I have a bit of property I need to unload today. It's a small villa on the other side of the island. The area is a bit dangerous, but it's good property and I'm willing to part with it for only 100,000 shillings."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "I have secret knowledge that there will soon be a shortage of brew. I've stockpiled a couple of barrels away. If you want, I'll hold them here until the shortage begins, but you can be the owner of them for only 900 shillings. Think about it, you'll be able to charge any price you want for a cup of brew."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "This wasn't really an inn before people from your land started coming here. Long ago it was built to house the Avar ambassadors. Well, after the treaties fell apart, this mainly got used by soldiers who, well, let's just say, didn't feel like sleeping in their barracks."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "This is a wonderful place to stay the night. Don't let the noise from downstairs bother you. It usually quiets down around midnight."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kYou hear shouting and laughter coming from the tavern beneath here.
KocatanInnKeeper			~kA loud crash from downstairs startles you. Presumably used to such sounds, Moxal pays no attention to it.
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "If you are out in the jungle, you might want to ask Wulfgang about his inventory."
KocatanLanguageMaster		ants	~kQuetzal says, "Yokinich would be a giant insect, a giant ant. Add the word red, and you have kawilkinich, for the mutant red ant."
KocatanLanguageMaster		avar	~kQuetzal says, "The bird people are smart enough to form a semi-coherent language, but that hardly makes them civilized."
KocatanLanguageMaster		buy	~kQuetzal says, "I have a few things here I could sell you."
KocatanLanguageMaster		dissect	~kQuetzal says, "How about dissecting insects. The basic insect is called a kinich. A little insect, such as a baby spider, would be an imixkinich."
KocatanLanguageMaster		hello	~kQuetzal says, "Greetings, %NAME, that's an interesting name you have. What is its origins?"
KocatanLanguageMaster		help	~kQuetzal says, "I'm easily the most intelligent person in this settlement. I know all about Language Structure, History, and Philosophy. I can even teach simpletons to speak Ko'catanese fluently."
KocatanLanguageMaster		kinich	~kQuetzal says, "Kauil means poisonous, so a scorpion is a kinkauilkinich and a giant spider is a teotkauilkinich. Ants are similar."
KocatanLanguageMaster		ko'catan	~kQuetzal snidely remarks, "Ko'catan literally means 'master warriors fortification.' It just screams how primitive our society is. It may as well be called 'dumb bullies' hideout.'"
KocatanLanguageMaster		konima	~kQuetzal says, "Yeah, Konima was a great warrior who fought the orcs, but he hardly founded this society. Our language and culture came out of a lost group of ruffians thirsting for civilization in a most inhospitable region."
KocatanLanguageMaster		sell	~kQuetzal says, "Do you have any books or scrolls?"
KocatanLanguageMaster		teach	~kQuetzal says, "Stay here and listen to me. I'll help you learn our language."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Most foreigners can't grasp the simple rules of pronunciation. For example, take the letter 'X.' A true member of Ko'catan starts the letter at the back of the throat as if about to spit. The sound ends up like 'sh' in your word 'wish.'"
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Let me teach you how to properly pronounce our 'O's. Tense your tongue and round your lips in a tight circle. 'O's are always long and stressed in a word. Such that our 'Ot' sounds like your 'coat.'"
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Always stress the first syllable in any Ko'catan word. In addition, put an equal amount of stress on an syllable that immediately follows an apostrophe. Ko'catan is KO - CAtan."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "I'm the only one in town who has the skill necessary to teach language. By all accounts, I should be Quetzal ko'Atezya."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "You are pronouncing our 'E' wrong. Make it softer and bring it to the front of your mouth. We say, 'get,' not 'git,' 'geet' or 'gat.'"
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Our 'A's are almost always soft and long as in 'balm.' Relax your tongue more and widen your lips. That's it."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "I don't understand most of your people's names. They don't seem to have very much structure."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "I also know a bit of Avar speak, but not enough to properly teach it. If you really want to talk with those creatures, you should seek Franz zax'Ak."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Much of our language is created by a logical sequence of sounds and meanings. Shall I dissect some words for you?"
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Many of our words have three sylables, like puucmecmoch. That's a monster that is both plant and animal, by the way."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Kohuzotz live out on the island. Bahal knows more about them than anyone. Ask him."
KocatanMadScientist		buy	~kBahal says, "Keep your toys."
KocatanMadScientist		bye	~kBahal says, "Come back and tell me if you start to feel... odd. I ask for no reason in particular."
KocatanMadScientist		enlighten	~kBahal says, "Listen closely... ~IMurder~I is the key. Slaughter opponents of the opposite extreme and your karma will reach the level you desire."
KocatanMadScientist		hanla	~kBahal says, "The girl should cook and clean for me, instead of her father. Why he... " Bahal stops and then smiles to himself, "No, I don't think I will tell you."
KocatanMadScientist		hello	~kBahal says, "Good, you are here. Step a little closer. Closer."
KocatanMadScientist		Hello	~kBahal says, "Hmm, how can I best use you?"
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_BAD	help	~kBahal says, "Why should I help ~Iyou~I?"
KocatanMadScientist		help	~kBahal says, "Help you?! Perhaps we can help each other. Go stand by the back table and close your eyes."
KocatanMadScientist		Ko'catan	~kBahal says, "Oh, I have plans for Ko'catan."
KocatanMadScientist		KOhuzotz	~kBahal says, "Kohuzotz. Those little dragon critters. Delicious yet more valuable in other ways."
KocatanMadScientist		Konima	~kBahal says, "If only those ignorant barbarians knew the true, dark secrets of their fallen martyr."
KocatanMadScientist		kriipa	~kBahal says, "It took me months to capture a live kriipa. They hide in the most unusual places."
KocatanMadScientist		learn	~kBahal says, "I could teach you so very much. But what is the use, you would surely go insane. Like the others."
KocatanMadScientist		plans	~kBahal says, "You think I have no brain matter?! Keep your long nose on your face and not in mine."
KocatanMadScientist		riija	~kBahal says, "You seek the shadow god? You will not find what you expect."
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_GOOD	secrets	~kBahal cackles, "I will say only this, Konima slaughtered more women than orcs."
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_NOT_GOOD	secrets	~kBahal says, "I'll not slip my tongue and give you reason to incite another witch hunt after me."
KocatanMadScientist		sell	~kBahal says, "You would not want what I have."
KocatanMadScientist		teach	~kBahal says, "I could teach you so very much. But what is the use, you would surely go insane. Like the others."
KocatanMadScientist		teotkriipa	~kBahal says, "I created them to take care of the problem with the utom. They are marvelous hunters. Nearly intangible due to the nether element, yet with the ferocity of a kriipa."
KocatanMadScientist		utom	~kBahal says, "Those ugly man-like creatures in the caves that border Ko'catan."
KocatanMadScientist		ways	~kBahal says, "You would not understand."
KocatanMadScientist		Wulfgang	~kBahal says, "Wulfgang has his uses."
KocatanMadScientist		yes	~kBahal smirks and writes something down on a small pad and tucks it back in his apron.
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_BAD		~kBahal says, "Go away now."
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_BAD		~kBahal stares at you. You have the uncomfortable feeling that he is peering into your soul.
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_BAD		~kBahal glares at you, "I am done with you! Leave!"
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_BAD		~kBahal screams, "~BGet out! You are contaminating my work!~B"
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_BAD		~kBahal gets an insane look in his eyes and begins chasing you around the hut with a butcher knife. After a few minutes, he shakes his head and ignores you.
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_BAD		~kBahal uncorks at small vial. Within moments, you begin to feel nauseous. Your body seems to tell you it may be a good idea to get some fresh air soon.
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_GOOD		~kBahal says, "How many people have you killed in your life? You look like you could be murderer."
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_GOOD		~kBahal says, "I need to clean up from my experiment, then I'll be with you."
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_GOOD		~kBahal quickly eats what looks like a small bug.
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kBahal says, "Do you feel strange?" Oddly enough, you temporarily lose your sense of balance.
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kBahal points a short twig at you. For a moment, you can't feel your tongue in your mouth. The feeling passes as he puts away the stick.
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kYour vision starts to blur a little. You smell a faint trace of something similar to vinegar. 
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kYou suddenly feel your skin tighten on your flesh. Bahal chuckles to himself as he replaces something small into a dark, wooden box.
KocatanMadScientist	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kBahal offers you something small in his hand. Before he can give it to you, he screams, "~BOw! It bit me!~B" He then hurriedly rummages through some boxes and then gulps down a vial of pink fluid.
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "I can never seem to get enough Kohuzotz."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Shall I enlighten you the how to reach the very extremes of Good and Evil?"
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Stick around for a while, I have something I want to try out on you. It will hurt a little. Well, actually quite a lot."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "How much do you weigh and what exactly have you eaten today?"
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal carefully measures the cover of an unbound book. He walks up to you, pokes at your flesh, and then frowns while saying, "Too soft."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal cleans a small carcass of what you can only assume was a bird. He discards all but the innards.
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Where exactly do you come from and when were you born?"
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "I need a single drop of salted water. Can you spare a tear? I can help you to produce one."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal pricks you with a long needle, takes a few drops of blood and adds it to a dark potion.
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Move a little to your left." He then adjusts some contraption in your direction.
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Have you seen the Teotkriipa? I am very proud of that experiment."
KocatanShopKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD	business	~kPacal says, "I love business!"
KocatanShopKeeper		buy	~kPacal says, "I'll buy all sorts of things."
KocatanShopKeeper		goodbye	~kPacal says, "Goodbye now."
KocatanShopKeeper		Hello	~kPacal says, "Hi. Come on in."
KocatanShopKeeper		help	~kPacal says, "I am here to serve you."
KocatanShopKeeper		ko'catan	~kPacal says, "Ko'catan is the city that Konima founded here where he came to die. The city has grown considerably, but we still call it by the same name."
KocatanShopKeeper		konima	~kPacal says, "That is the military leader here. A very powerful man. He takes his title straight from the original warlord who led our people here."
KocatanShopKeeper		sell	~kPacal says, "Everything here is for sale."
KocatanShopKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kPacal says, "I love my stuff. You might be surprised at some of the items that I have."
KocatanShopKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kPacal says, "Watch your step!"
KocatanShopKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kPacal says, "I have heard that in your land you wrap the dead in rags, and then they rise to become napleoc and plague the land! Could this be true? Are you that stupid, zax'nap?"
KocatanShopKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kPacal says, "Tezotz make your sewers much more perilous to travel than our own, I think... in this city, sewer travel may not be the most ~Iglamorous~I way to get around, but it can be expedient if the occasion necessitates."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "Sometimes it's best to ask me if you're looking for a particular item. My filing system is... unique, and I'm afraid a bit confusing."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "This building served as the arsenal for the kici'ca for many years, for at that time it was strategically placed near the entrance to the Utom warrens. With time though, those were sealed up and now we seldom dwell upon the threat that lives down there."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "It is quite remarkable that you were able to make it here at all from the land across and beneath the water."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "I was in the kici'ca, but not as a soldier. I served my duty as a quartermaster."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "I suppose you might say I'm as much a collector as I am a merchant. That is how I am known here in any case, which is why the last sound on my name, Pacal ix'Anoak is the 'ak' sound. That means I am a merchant."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "This building, being an old military building, has some singular features in its design."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "Just let me know if there's anything I can help you find."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kThe old armory is very cool inside.
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "The prices are ~Inot~I negotiable."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "Hmmm... "
KocatanTailor		avar	~kTepal says, "I hear the Avar have a peculiar interest in precious stones."
KocatanTailor		buy	~kTepal says, "Well, um, what do you have I guess?"
KocatanTailor		goodbye	~kTepal says, "Goodbye, until the next time we meet."
KocatanTailor		Hello	~kTepal says, "Uh, hello %NAME."
KocatanTailor		help	~kTepal says, "You're in the Tailor's Shop. Ko'catan. What, um, what do you need?"
KocatanTailor	MOOD_BAD	Ko'catan	~kTepal says, "Are you here to do business?"
KocatanTailor	MOOD_NOT_BAD	Ko'catan	~kTepal says, "Ko'catan is the name of this city. In our language this is, um, this is how it works. Tan is the word for fortress. So we are here in, um, in a tan. But what tan? Ko is the word for greatest, or master, ca is the modifier for warrior. So Ko'ca is master warrior, and Ko'catan is the master warrior's fortress. You see?"
KocatanTailor	MOOD_BAD	konima	~kTepal says, "What do you, um, what do you want to know?"

KocatanTailor			~kTepal says, "Can I help you find something, um, something in particular?"
KocatanTailor			~kTepal says, "I have some beautiful cloth to work with just now. Our cloth makers are making the most of all the new dyes and materials that are trickling in from the mainland."
KocatanTailor			~kTepal says, "I think my robes are becoming a popular item back on the land across and beneath the water, where you come from. People are buying them to take, um, take back home with them. Business has never been better."
KocatanTailor			~kTepal says, "You look like about size katalin. Maybe a size katalin waz, but more on the katalin side of katalin waz."
KocatanTailor			~kTepal watches you pleasantly. Sizing you up.
KocatanTailor			~kYou feel a cool draft from the back of the shop.
KocatanTailor			~kTepal twitches a bit. He seems... uncomfortable.

KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NOT_BAD	Balo na'te Din	~kWulfgang says, "You have heard of this battle, have you? I was a scout there, for the a'ach kici'ca. You cannot imagine, unless you were there, zax'ta. Three days of slaughter, and at the end we left with half the men we went in with. All for a square of jungle that you couldn't even plant a decent crop of brown corn on."

KocatanTradeMaster		inventory	~kWulfgang says, "I'm not looking for anything now."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NOT_BAD	language	~kWulfgang says, "The Meridian language is ugly compared to the language of Ko'catan. In Meridian we say ant, they say ~Iyokinich~I. We say mutant ant, ugh, and they say ~Ikawilkinich~I. Beautiful, isn't it? Odd that such a blunt, war-like people would have such a beautiful way with words."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD	Marion	~kWulfgang says, "Marion was home to me for twenty years, and my heart of hearts is back there as we speak. But I will never return."

KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_BAD		~kWulfgang says, "Kateriina is not queen yet? Ha ha ha! That is funny!"
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_BAD		~kWulfgang says, "It wasn't easy getting here from the mainland and getting myself established. I'm talking about setting up shop between the various Avar tribes and those lunatic dimwits you probably noticed on the other side of the island, holed up behind a huge wall. Nearly got myself killed fifty times trying. And now all of you show up here, like a bunch of Barloque tourists. I'd get out of here, but I don't know where else to go."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_BAD		~kWulfgang says, "The next time you guys fight your silly way through the Orc warrens, why don't you bring Ran er'Hoth with you? At least then we'd have some decent conversation in here!"
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_BAD		~kWulfgang says, "Looks to me like the quality of adventurers has slipped a bit since last time I was in Meridian. You're a pathetic lot. Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_BAD		~kWulfgang says, "Say, is that a short sword you've got with you? Well equipped for our little jungles, I see!"
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_BAD		~kWulfgang doesn't take his eyes off you. He seems in a menacing mood.
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_BAD		~kWulfgang says, "I think you'd be safer back in Tos. You need to start heading in that direction."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_BAD		~kWulfgang says, "Go on. Get out of here, I'm through with you."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "The next time you are back in Marion, say hello to Tova for me, would you?"
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "I know Meridian. I should, I lived there for twenty-five years before I was exiled to this place."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "If you are able to get raw neurodite from the city to me, I will pay you well. I have many ~Icustomers~I for neurodite. It is a profitable trade for everyone with these embargoes in effect."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "The new followers of Riija that will make their way back to the mainland must be very careful, for Riija has many enemies among the other gods. It is believed that Duke Akardius follows Riija."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "I am the last of my people, the Riija followers from the underground sect on the mainland. Where you come from, and whence I came some years ago."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "The followers of Riija were an underground movement in all of the parts of Meridian that survived despite great hardship for many, many years. Eventually the followers of Kraanan declared a secret war upon us, a war of annihilation. When the time came that I was the only survivor, I fled and came to this place. I have been here since."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "When the followers of Kraanan came with blades for my people, it was with the blessing of Zarcos IV, the King then. When his son Zarcos V took over, he put a stop to it and although we lived as outlaws, the few that survived the previous years didn't have to live in fear of the butchers of Kraanan. But when Zarcos V abdicated, Duke Kalior renewed enthusiasm for the destruction of Riija followers entirely from the mainland. I am the only survivor now. My magic has kept me alive."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "You didn't happen to bring any nerudite with you, did you?"
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "You'll never guess how I finally got here from the mainland. I meditated for three days and fasted for three days and then I made a big wish and I blinked. That's right I blinked! The spell, blink, I blinked from the fountain in Tos and I got nauseous and when I came to I was in the jungle here!! Sometimes the most unassuming weapon in your arsenal can save you where the battering ram will fail."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "Drink to the good life, my friends. Drink to those that cannot be here with us to drink."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kWulfgang says, "The next time you're in the Limping Toad, have a drink for me."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "You will soon learn to watch the canopy above when you are traveling the jungle. Death waits above where the Kriipa lives."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "I've got a few rooms downstairs that I board travelers in. Right now they are full, there are some... ~Isemi-permenant~I guests staying over. We don't see them at the breakfast table much."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "Drink to Meridian!"
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "This island is bountiful."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "Travelers from afar, eh? Well, you make yourself at home."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "I do a modest business between the Avar and the few travelers that come through here. That and the so-called Kici'ca, the Ko'catani Legion. You just never know who is going to want what."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "The Legions of Ko'catan fight the Avar. The Avar ambush the Legions. The Avar fight the Avar. The Legions fight the Avar fighting the Avar. The Avar fight the Avar fighting the Legions. And in the middle of it all is Wulfgang, sitting in my trading post getting drunk and rolling in money. I live by my wits alone."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "The Avar are as reasonable a civilization as there ever was. If you know their ways. But to know their ways, you need to speak Avar. And I speak Avar."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "The Ko'catani Legions are a crafty and spirited army. But they cannot hold the island. The Avar are very good at choosing their battleground, and at simply fading away when they would rather not fight."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "There has been a relative peace between the Ko'catani and the Avar for about five years. Understand that it means that they are not fighting ~Ievery~I day. But there is tension, and many trade restrictions."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "To the Avar race, magic isn't a study or a devotion as we know it. The magical Avar, the Avar'ya as the Konimians call them, are born with one eye right in the middle of their head. They are the only Avar that have the ability to learn magic."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "The Avar are an interesting race, but not what you would call consistent. It has taken me a number of years to learn their language, and I'm not sure I'll ever have their confidence. But they are a lot smarter than those people in the settlement, I'll tell you that."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "Who's here to deal?"
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "Take shelter from the storm here, traveler. I work hard enough to keep this place safe; enjoy the leisure before you go back out there into the jungle."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang has a voice like someone pulling down a barn.
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang chuckles to himself.
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "There is food in the kitchen, and I have both ale and Atz'pekonch, the finest Kocatani wine. And I mean this stuff is the best, I got it through military connections."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "Take a place by the fire and tell of your travels."
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang seems to be listening intently to the jungle outside.
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang coughs.
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kThere is the smell of smoked meat and sweet spilled wine about this place.
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang glances up at you.
KocatanTradeMaster	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kWulfgang says, "What news, awkward one?"
KocatanVaultman	MOOD_BAD		~kItzal sighs and says, "Not you again."
KocatanVaultman	MOOD_GOOD		~kItzal says, "Thank you for coming in our Vaults, good %SIRMADAM.", then whispers to Huital, "Was that all right?"
KocatanVaultman	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kItzal says, "I'm tired, Huit. Let me go home early tonight."
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal stares blankly at the wall and belches repeatedly.
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal scratches his backside.
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "You don't want me to go ~Iback~k down that vault to retrieve something, do you?!"
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "Hey Huital, can I take a break? My legs are tired."
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal's eyes flutter closed and his mouth hangs open. In a few seconds, he begins snoring.
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "Huital, I need some extra money. I accidentally broke one of the customer's flasks."
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal places his hands in the water and splashes his face. Huital gives him a scathing glare.
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal swats at a buzzing fly.
KocatanVaultman			~kYou are suddenly confronted by a very unpleasant odor. Itzal smiles to himself.
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "Excuse me. Shouldn't have eaten at the Monster today."
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "I think I lost some of Ixla's armor pieces. I hope she doesn't hurt me for it."

KocatanWeaponsMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kKochtal says, "I sense you are respected in your land. That is good, friend."
KocatanWeaponsMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kKochtal says, "I have heard praise of you from another traveler. Be proud."

KocatanWeaponsMaster	MOOD_GOOD		~kKochtal says, "You have already proved yourself strong since you have traversed the utom caves."
KocatanWeaponsMaster	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kKochtal says, "As I hear, your land has little structure. The Kingdom is divided and the towns in conflict. Ko'catan does not need such influence."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "In Ko'catan, our people must earn their names. One does not chose to ascend to cha or ko. Others will decide that for them."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Our culture has many established customs and mores. We do not hesitate to outcast those who can not adhere to them."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Every person has a purpose and a defined rank here. We allow you in our walls. Do not presume to disrupt the order of Ko'catan."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "There is no art of war. War is the antithesis of art. Those who find beauty in war have never seen in a battle."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Skilled at weaponry makes a soldier competent. To be truly formidable, the warrior must also have patience, forethought and allies."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "You must have compassion. A cold hearted warrior is less effective than one who cares, for they have nothing worthwhile to lose."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Our society has survived for over 200 years based on one principal--'structure'. With no structure, there is only chaos."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Many years ago I lost my eyes defending the outer walls. I am of little use as a warrior now. That is why I must teach."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal sniffs the air and says, "The warriors have returned from a hunt."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal cranes his neck as if listening intently. You hear nothing. After a moment he smiles and says, "She won't find him at the tavern."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal begins a slow routine of stretching and bending.
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal gropes around for his weapons. After a moment, his hands find an old, rusted short sword. He whispers, "There you are, old friend."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Those avars can be fairly crafty. There is one that surrounds itself with death. It knows about Riija."

MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	barloque	~kTova says, "Barloque is in the north, and claims itself the Royal City of Meridian. But I try not to knock the rich. I never got a job from a poor person, don't you know!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	blessed	~kTova says, "I have heard that ~I his Majesty the King ~I is ~I in the sanctuary, ~I under the care of ~I Lady Aftyn ~I!! They say that soon he will be fit again to rule, %SIRMADAM!! Oh, blessed saints, oh glorious day!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	bye	~kTova says, "Don't bother coming back."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	bye	~kTova says, "May you fare well, %SIRMADAM."
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	cor NOTH	~kTova says without looking at you, "What, are you still here?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	cor NOTH	~kTova says, "Cor Noth now, is just a step behind the rest of us. You see, they've got their heads in the clouds and their feet are not on the ground. Aye, but it's a fine place, and do they love to talk %SIRMADAM! Did you hear the one about how years ago, Tos and Barloque went to war? Well, Tos and Barloque had some silly dispute, and their pride to boot, and neither city would move an inch to meet the other. Finally, without any hope of negotiations they figured the only resort was to start a war between themselves. The next day, Cor Noth surrendered! Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender		council	~kTova says, "Yes, well the council... you will hear a lot of talk about the council, but not in Marion. We stay out of the politics and intrigue here, %SIRMADAM."
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	crypt	~kTova says, "Who was the fool that opened that sacred resting place? Probably some fool looking for treasure."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	crypt	~kTova says, "Watch yourself! I hear those that prey on others hunt there."
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kTova says, "I guess he got his... "
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	duke	~kTova says, "I hear Akardius has taken well to his uncle's duties. How convenient."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	faren	~kTova says, "No offense intended, but my religion is right here in my mug, %SIRMADAM. How about I pour you a pint of salvation?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	fey	~kTova says, "Aye, the wee things are a sight to see all right! Myself and Morrigan went up north there to get a look for ourselves, didn't we Morrigan? Unpredictable though, I'm not ashamed to say we turned and ran when the little buggers turned nasty on us! You should have seen us coming out of those woods!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	Hello	~kTova says, "And who are you? Get out, we don't have what you need."
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	Hello	~kTova sneers, "What are they flushing out of the sewers of Barloque now, Morrigan? Look what the cat dragged in."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	Hello	~kTova shouts, "Come in, my friend. What took you so long to get here?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	Hello	~kTova says, "Ah, good evening %SIRMADAM. Look who's here, Morrigan!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	Hello	~kTova says, "Aye, come in, come in, let's get you something to warm up your bones now."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	Hello	~kTova says, "It's a fine evening %SIRMADAM, sure it is."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	Hello	~kTova says, "And a good day to you, %SIRMADAM! Can I get you something to drink, or perhaps a bite of food?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	Hello	~kTova says, "Good day there. What will you have, %SIRMADAM?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	Hello	~kTova says, "Ah, hello there %SIRMADAM."

MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	jasper	~kTova says without looking at you, "What, are you still here?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	jasper	~kTova says, "Oh, yes, it's to the south of here and up high in the mountains. The people up there are their own sort, fierce and independent %SIRMADAM. Not the type you want to pick a fight with."
MarionBartender		kalior	~kTova says, "Hush now Morrigan, you know better than that. It's best not to speak so with all these people here."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	kraanan	~kTova says, "No offense intended, but my religion is right here in my mug, %SIRMADAM. How about I pour you a pint of salvation?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	lady aftyn	~kTova says, "They say that she is of nobility, from Barloque, and that her husband left her a fortune after he passed on %SIRMADAM. Aye, they also say that the fortune is right here in Marion with her, at the asylum."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	lady aftyn	~kTova says, "She is a saint. An absolute saint. Bless her heart."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	marion	~kTova says, "Marion? Well, you're looking at it my friend, unless you need a shovel mended or the counsel of an ancient madman."

MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	rugby	~kTova says, "I still play, front row, loose-head prop for Marion. I love a good ruck more than anything, especially if one of the Tos centers is at the bottom. If it's on the field, it's grass is what I say. Ha, ha ha ha ha ha!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	sanctuary	~kTova says, "I have heard that ~Ihis Majesty the King~I is ~Iin the sanctuary~I, under the care of ~ILady Aftyn~I!! They say that soon he will be fit again to rule, %SIRMADAM!! Oh, blessed saints, oh glorious day!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	sell	~kTova says, "This is a tavern, my friend. It's not too complicated."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	shal'ille	~kTova says, "You'd be better asking the Good Lady Aftyn about Shal'ille. She is versed in the ways, and such a kind soul."
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	tos	~kTova says, "A pox on that town. Why don't you take your business elsewhere, stranger, because you're not welcome here."
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	tos	~kTova says without looking at you, "What, are you still here?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kTova says, "By the Holy Martyrs, it's a miserable place. Aye, take my advice on this, %SIRMADAM. I spent a fair piece of my youth there, and I'll never go back. The people of Tos are so lazy, they can't even exercise their discretion!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	tos	~kTova says, "Tos is a town with little cheer, and let me warn you about the public house there, %SIRMADAM. The innkeeper Paddock is a muddy-headed liar, as likely to swindle you down as offer you a beer. He's the type of man who never exaggerates his accomplishments, but he tries his best. You know, the type of man that would belittle his inferiors, if he could find any. Ha, ha, ha, ha!!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	treefolk	~kTova says, "Yes, there are treefolk in these parts, a kind and legendary creature that keep very much among themselves. The elders of Marion speak of their wisdom and intelligence, but they keep entirely to themselves now. It is said that something terrible happened to them in the past, isolating them to this day."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	whiskey	~kTova says, "Troll Whiskey? You have some? Hey Morrigan, get the good glasses down from the shelf and dust them off!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	wryn's	~kTova says, "You ask the people in Jasper how they feel about The Wryn's Keep, that thief Frular of Barloque renting it out like a common grange hall... why that's their ancestral capitol, and in the heart of everyone from Jasper!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	wryn's	~kTova says, "Aye, it's an old fortress outside of Jasper, and the traditional capital of the mountain kingdom of old. It is said that a half-hundred good fighters could hold the Cragged Mountains against an army if they hold The Wryn's Keep."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD	Wulfgang	~kTova says, "Wulfgang? You must mean the same Wulfgang that I know. I'll drink to that devil."
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD	zig	~kTova says, "Some things are better left unsaid, and I'll tell you this on your way out of me bar, that black name is one of them."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD	zig	~kTova amiably says, "Now I don't know what you might be talking about there."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL	zig	~kTova hisses, "Those black-hearted thugs, sneaking around and spying on innocent folk... they should be hunted down like wild dogs and put on the gallows with their black-hearted master, the Duke."
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kTova says, "Did you folks see Ran er'Hoth on the way into town? Crazy as a march hare, that man, aye but that's a different story now. Many of the people passing through Marion stop in on him, ha, ha, and seek his wisdom!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kTova says, "I spent some time in Tos, and I'll tell you now, it's a place that hides from its own evil intentions. Ignorant, lazy people. Why, even the dead are restless, and rise from the ground to haunt the graveyard! Aye, it's true!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kTova says, "Keep the noise down over there, or you'll find yourselves on the street!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_BAD		~kTova grumbles, and busies himself cleaning glasses.
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova says, "Aye, the hotel rooms in Barloque may look small, but it's only because the rats are so big. It must be the rich diet, don't you think, Morrigan?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova says, "Lady Aftyn now, is a newcomer to this town. She is a real Lady, and I won't tolerate any bad talk of her in here. She helps those that are in need... the sick, wretched, the injured, and the impoverished."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova says, "Paddock is the type of guy who started out in life at the bottom... and then sank."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova recites, "Fams is the tavern in Tos Where the paths of all Meridian cross, but when you go there you'll wonder just who made the blunder and made the village idiot the boss!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova says, "Ah, there's nothing wrong with Paddock that reincarnation won't fix."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova says, "That Paddock never did a thing in his life, and even that he hasn't done well."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova says, "A fella I know told Paddock he should just try to be himself. Isn't that terrible advice? Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova says, "Ah sure, everybody loves Paddock, and so does he."
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova says, "I heard Paddock was trying to hire a dwarf to help him behind the bar... he thinks it will make the drinks look bigger!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_GOOD		~kTova says, "Did you hear about the man from Marion, an honest farmer now, who was stabbed thirty-five times in his own home? Aye, he was only learning to eat with a fork!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova has a mug, and takes a sip occasionally.
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "So this adventurer walks into the tavern, he wants to know where he can find a troll. I says, well, depends on where you left him! Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "No, but in fairness now, if you want to improve your skills at combat, you'd do best to pick a fight that you'll have ~I some ~I trouble finishing."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "When you're feeling a little worn out, you can be sure you'll be welcome at The Limping Toad, %SIRMADAM. I think you'll find an inn or a tavern is the place to rest up."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "If you're new to the business of fighting monsters, then you'd best stick to battling those beasties that are within your abilities. Aye, many young adventure types hunt the rats, and the baby spiders."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Marion may be a slow kind of place, but we remember what's important and keep our houses in order. It always pays to be respectful to those you meet, and you will learn important lessons that will help to guide you."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "I've heard that the temples serving the four gods are remote, but that they are accessible to the devoted. In truth the temple of Shal'ille is close to this town, and many a pilgrim stops in my little tavern for a little... fortification... on their way to see the priestess."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Gather up interesting things along the trail, you can never tell what may draw a shilling or two in town, %SIRMADAM. Morrigan there may even be interested, for he peddles all sorts of nonsense back there in his nook. Isn't that right, Morrigan?"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "If it's the fighting you're curious about now, why then go see Rook up in Cor Noth. He was a great officer in the King's Army, %SIRMADAM, and a hero to many of us. He makes his living now by training those that live and die by the sword."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Watch for the living trees in these parts, for they are a wonder indeed. But do not harm them... it is bad luck and misfortune upon those that do."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Watch your step in the mountains. The paths up there are treacherous, and overrun with every kind of evil beast %SIRMADAM."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Colhorr, now, in fairness... he's a competent blacksmith, %SIRMADAM, and may have a few items that would draw your eye. Aye, but he's deaf as a post from hitting that anvil longer than you and I have been in breeches, so speak clearly when you talk to him."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "This is a great life in Marion, %SIRMADAM, I learn more than you might suspect from serving the locals and the passers through. Aye, and sometimes enjoy a pint or two myself."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "You know the recipe for making chicken soup in Jasper? Well now first thing, you steal two chickens... "
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "On the other hand, you have different fingers. Ha, ha, ha, ha!! Different fingers!! Get it Morrigan? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Good %SIRMADAM, did you know the people of Marion invented the wheelbarrow? Aye, well, then they gave the design to the good folk of Jasper, to teach them to walk upright... "
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "A farmer from Marion is lying in bed next to his wife. He tells her 'Dear wife, I've got terrible insomnia.' 'Well,' she says 'If you go to sleep, it won't bother you.' Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "I knew this fella from Jasper who never had a shilling to his name... so he changed his name!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Aye, I know another fella from Tos, who is so lazy he can sleep twenty-four hours a day. The only trouble is, he sleeps thirty hours a day."
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "And this woman I know from Tos, known her all my life, I swear to the blessed saints. She is ~Iso~I lazy she could become a landmark! By the gods, there's nothing else of interest to see in that wretched place! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Good %SIRMADAM, I heard about a fella from Tos who was so lazy, that he died at twenty-five and no one figured it out until he was fifty!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "I've got this brother-in-law, can't keep a shilling to his name. He borrows so much money from me, at night my wife goes through HIS pockets!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Good %SIRMADAM, did you hear about the Lady in Barloque, men always wanted her hand in marriage. The problem is that they had to take the rest of her too! Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "I know an old man here in Marion, a bit simple like many of the others in these parts. But you've got to give him this... he'll never be too old to learn a few new ways to be stupid!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "This fella passed through the tavern a while back, and Morrigan told me afterward that he was an outlaw. Said he's a wanted man in Barloque. So I asked Morrigan, now why do you think they would want any more thieves in Barloque? Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Before we were married, my wife would always complain, 'You're only after one thing.' Aye, now I've forgotten what it was. Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "Two Ladies from Barloque are talking. One Lady says 'How do you keep your youth?' The other Lady says, 'Well, I lock him in the closet!' Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "I got one for you. What's the difference between a woman from Cor Noth and an Orc? About forty pounds and a scimitar!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "A man hereabouts went to the healer, only to find out he had but six months left to live. The healer now, she suggested that he sell his house in Marion, and move to Cor Noth. So the man says 'Will that help me live longer?' 'No,' the healer says, 'but it will certainly seem longer!'"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova winks at Morrigan good-naturedly.
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "I hear the Princess said that civilization in Barloque will last ten thousand years. She forgot to tell us when it's going to begin. Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kTova says, "So this farmer walks into the tavern here, and asks me what time it is. I tell him it's four-fifteen. He narrows his eyes looking at me and says 'I must be going crazy, Tova. All day long I've been getting different answers!' Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
MarionBartender	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kTova says, "Nodes? I don't node nothing about nodes. How about you, Morrigan? Do you node about nodes? Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	barloque	~kColhorr says, "Broke? What's broke? Let's have a look, maybe I can fix it."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	broke	~kColhorr says, "Ah, well... it's a fair city, grand actually. Aye it's a grand city, certainly grand, grand grand grand capital of Meridian."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	bye	~kColhorr mumbles something to himself.
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	bye	~kColhorr says, "Yes, well, good bye now."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	centipede	~kColhorr says, "Centipede? Well, I know that they look awful, but in fairness now they are quite harmless if you let them be."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	cor NOTH	~kColhorr says, "What? East Tos? East Tos, uh... aye, well, Tos is east of here, through Ileria, that's a valley. To the east. Just east, actually. But aye, it's east. East. And the bank's there, sure."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	council	~kColhorr says, "Council? Uh, that doesn't ring any bells."
MarionBlacksmith		crypt	~kColhorr shivers and says, "That crypt scares me silly."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	duke	~kColhorr says, "In Marion? No, no, there's no Duke in Marion. But there is a Lady, and what a kind soul she is, indeed. A real Lady. She lives to help the unfortunate, Marion's own saint."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	hello	~kColhorr says, "Huh? I thought I told you you're not welcome here."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	hello	~kColhorr says, "Yes? Oh, hello there, hello... "
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	hello	~kColhorr says, "Yes?"
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	help	~kColhorr says, "What do you need help with? This is a simple place, not too difficult to figure out, so I can't see where you'd need help with that. Aye, there's plenty I could teach you, you bet, but you certainly don't need my help to get around Marion."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	hot	~kColhorr says, "Of course it's hot! You think I don't know it's hot in here? I KNOW it's hot in here. You don't need to tell me it's hot in here, after thirty-five years at this forge, I know exactly how hot it is in here. Humpf. Hot."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	jasper	~kColhorr says, "Jasper? No, no you must be lost, %SIRMADAM. You're in MARION... that's right, MARION, M-A-R-I-O-N."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	marion	~kColhorr says, "Aye, indeed this is Marion. That's exactly where you are. What can I do for you %SIRMADAM?"
MarionBlacksmith		mining	~kColhorr says, "What? Mimes? Where? And how many?"
MarionBlacksmith		mine	~kColhorr says, "What? Mimes? Where? And how many?"
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	orc	~kColhorr says, "Goodness, you're better off staying away from the orcs altogether. Foul creatures, sworn enemies of all people. Why I remember a day when armies were raised to hunt them down and smash them completely. Aye, I've seen some of the weapons that those orcs make. Oh boy. Impressive. Scimitars with a blade as long as your arm."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	princess	~kColhorr says, "Shirtless? Well, I know it's not proper, but I put on my shirt whenever I go out of my shop! It's the heat from my forge, you see... well, you will notice it's quite hot in here. Hot. Yes, quite hot indeed."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD	ran er'hoth	~kColhorr screams, "That man is an idiot, and you don't have to be sauced on Troll Whiskey to see that. He has spent the last ten years ridiculing the people of Marion, and now has the nerve to return and expect charity from us. Well, he gets nothing from me. Nothing. Now be on your way."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_GOOD	ran er'hoth	~kColhorr says, "Ran er'Hoth? He... well, I suppose that you're going to hear this elsewhere, so I might as well put it kindly. He is a little touched. Aye, he is."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL	ran er'hoth	~kColhorr shouts, "Ran er'Hoth? Well now, it isn't kind to speak ill of the cretins and half-wits of the world, so I'll just hold my tongue."
MarionBlacksmith		rugby	~kColhorr says, "I was a pretty good tight-head prop in my day. I still play every fall in the annual Marion versus Barloque test match, not because I'm fit but because I'm mean as a raccoon. I'll rip the faces off those rich guys half my age."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	sell	~kColhorr says, "I might have a thing or two here you'd be interested in looking at."
MarionBlacksmith		sell	~kColhorr says, "Well, let's see... I make a couple of different weapons, and those are for sale. Otherwise, I am busy fixing things up for the farmers around Marion."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	teach	~kColhorr says, "Teach? Well, now... I know a few things, that's the truth. I know a bit about the old ways, for my people came out of the Cragged Mountains in my great-grandfathers time and brought the ways of Kraanan with them. They made their weapons from the ethers, just like that. Aye, there's some there I could show you too, but you need some understanding of his ways to use his magics."
MarionBlacksmith		tonto	~kColhorr says, "I love that guy. He played hooker on the Marion rugby team for a couple years, tough as a hammer."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD	tos	~kColhorr says, "Oh, Tos. Aye, well in Tos there is an arena where the warriors fight with great weapons. Great weapons, iron and steel, whatnot."
MarionBlacksmith		whiskey	~kColhorr says, "Aye, nasty stuff."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD		~kColhorr glares at you. 
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_BAD		~kColhorr says, "The shop is closed, all done for the day. Go on your way now."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kColhorr says, "If you've got old weapons you're looking to get rid of, might be I'm interested. Sure, can't keep too much scrap iron around."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kColhorr says, "Did you try our local tavern? That Tova now, he is a kick in the pants. Aye, a real hoot %SIRMADAM."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kColhorr says, "These are quiet parts. Good people, hard working people, er, with one exception."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr says, "You probably noticed that ramshackle hut across the way, near the stables. Well, it does stick out, seeing as the rest of the town is tidy, and proud. Aye, that's the hut of Ran er'Hoth, %SIRMADAM. I could tell you stories... "
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr says, "You look like you appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into a well made weapon, and I'll tell you what, so do I. Yes I do. I have quite a collection too, but I keep that somewhere safe."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr screams, "Did you say something about knitting needles?"
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr says, "Huh?"
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr says, "Oh, did you say something?"
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~k~IColhorr is sweating profusely.~I
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr says, "What's this?"
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr shouts, "Yes, well speak up please."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr scratches absently.
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr says, "What have you got there?"
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr screams, "AS FAR AS KARMA IS CONCERNED, I THINK THAT YOU TEND TO GO THE OPPOSITE WAY OF WHAT YOU'RE KILLING."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr says, "I hear more than they think, that's for sure."
MarionBlacksmith	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kColhorr yells, "WHAT WAS THAT?"
MarionBlacksmith			~k~IThe heat in this shop is almost unbearable.~I
MarionBlacksmith			~k~IThe blacksmith's shop is swelteringly hot.~I
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	afiera d'xor	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Seek him out. Go to the mountains and find him."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	alzahakar	~kRan er'Hoth says, "A very intelligent and hard working but naïve sorcerer who foolishly believed that he could harness the power of the magics. He has spent his life vying for mastery and understanding of a range of disciplines, Shal'ille, Kraanan, Qor, I believe, and Faren. Impressive, but misguided, for the power of these various forces have twisted his mind so that he is paranoid and delusive."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	baby spider	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Baby spiders are a nuisance, and a potentially deadly one so you must stay aware while in the forest. They shouldn't give you too many problems, though, as even the most inexperienced adventurers can deal with a baby spider. The biggest threat they pose is that sooner or later they grow up to become full grown spiders."
MarionElder		barloque	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Barloque is a corrupted volcano of filth disguised as a ghost town. Go there, child. You will see what I mean, exactly. They turn their poor out of the city, and lavish in opulence."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	bei naq	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Bei Naq was once a brilliant scholar, a very learned man. He learned everything so quickly, and such a memory... I remember meeting him as a young man, and the power of his intellect was awesome, his eyes burned through you; penetrating, understanding. But his appetite turned to acquiring wealth and material possessions, which has only gotten stronger in him with his advancing age. Now he is obsessed with what he has gathered, which has driven him away from contact with others, made him suspicious and small."
MarionElder		Brax	~kRan er'Hoth says, "An old city, destroyed by the foolish desires of a child."
MarionElder		bye	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Yes... "
MarionElder		cor NOTH	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Cor Noth is a very young town, just east of Marion. I remember when all that there was of the town was a way-station, but it has grown and built up a respectable university for itself. There is something else about that town... "
MarionElder	MOOD_BAD	council	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Council? Weeds grow between the council and what they speak, child, old men with rotten teeth and closed minds, each in their own self-imposed exile. They are philosophically bankrupt, for you cannot rule a people from where you've gone into hiding."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	council	~kRan er'Hoth says, "There is a Council of Five, last appointed by the father of the Princess, King Zarcos V, before he abdicated the throne and lost his marbles. Or did I get that in the wrong order? In any case, they are five elders from throughout the land, smart and powerful people within their limitations, but as a governing body they are toothless and lame, without any sort of executive apparatus at all. I know them. They are an advisory board without a King to advise, careful not to make any sudden moves for fear of drawing attention from any of a number of political factions that could shut them down overnight. So they bide their time and nod along, waiting for nothing. The Council is hobbled, and should absolve."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	council	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Council. An assembly called together for consultation, deliberation, etc.; An administrative, legislative, or advisory body. See, who says my memory isn't what it used to be?"
MarionElder	MOOD_BAD	crypt	~kRan er'Hoth screams, "You leave my mother alone!"
MarionElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	crypt	~kRan er'Hoth screams, "My mother is resting in there, the gods protect her. I go see her some nights."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	drechx	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Drechx is a brilliant physician, perhaps the greatest this land has ever known. However, he reached some unknowable point and he quit treating patients with his vast gift of healing altogether. In more recent years he seems to be entirely self centered, spends his time alone and in deep meditation. I suspect that with his understanding of the body and its energies he has completely halted his own aging process, perhaps even reversed it. Politically he is the wisest of the Council, and believes that the people must govern themselves and reject the false motivations of royalty, military, and factional leadership. But he lets his voice become lost to the others on the Council."
MarionElder	MOOD_BAD	duke	~kRan er'Hoth says, "There is a rhyme going around...Because of a poisoned dagger, there was one who did stagger... Then...There lies the Duke, all bloody in his puke!"
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	duke	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The Duke is dead. Why is there another Duke?"
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	duke	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Duke. A nobleman with the highest hereditary rank, a prince who rules an independent duchy. Duchy. The territory ruled by a duke or duchess; dukedom."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	faren	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Ask D'xor about Faren, for he has an understanding about these ways."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	faren	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The religion of the natural order, and the most unknowable. For this reason it is very dangerous to dabble in her magics, for you will never see clearly what powers you are tapping into to draw your spells, or where the power of those magics might disperse."
MarionElder		hello	~kRan er'Hoth says, "What's this?"
MarionElder		Hunter	~kRan er'Hoth says, "They are killers.  The question then becomes, 'Is there a place for justified vigilantes in our land?'  My answer is yes."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	jala	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The Jala magics are lost as a school. The power of these energies are random, unfocusable, and nature itself is out of balance without that focus, for all the other powers have it in abundance. But the power is not lost. The power is there waiting to resurface, with or without the guidance of practitioners. There are those around that understand enough of the old ways, that perhaps... "
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	jasper	~kRan er'Hoth says, "To the south, and tucked away in the mountains. The Jasper people are stones of the mountains, and each is but a part of the mountain itself, misleading little stones and rocks that carry the secrets of that hard place. They are a spirited, free people, once completely independent, and with their own language. But you'll never hear that spoken now."
MarionElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	king	~kRan er'Hoth says, "He always was a crafty man, Zarcos V. I understand that now he is in hiding, becrying that his wits have gone afoul, lost his marbles don't you know. But I wouldn't exactly count on that... he is a crafty man. Watch for him, for he is closer to the surface than he has been in nearly fifteen years, and if he is able, when he is able, he'll be making his move. Aye, and nearby he is, for I have seen that old goat Alzahakar lurking about... "
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	kraanan	~kRan er'Hoth says, "There are six schools, six orders to this world and to all worlds. All six are necessary to keep the flow of power in balance, and our world is now as a man who is fighting the water as he drowns because this balance is lost. Kraanan is guilty of perpetuating the division... and I'll say no more on this now."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	kraanan	~kRan er'Hoth says, "In my dream I have seen Kraanan, but he is not a god but a simple craftsman, mending boots and making mediocre garments of rough wool. In my dream the items that he produces are shoddy, and people buy them because they are nostalgic and pitiful of an old veteran who lives on the charitable actions of others. In my dream he has only one arm, and only one leg."
MarionElder		Lich	~kRan er'Hoth says, "It is rumored that this creature can not die.  Which poses a great obstacle for those who would see it's dark reign thwarted."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	marion	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The people here are passive, kind, and unquestioning, but don't mistake that for a lack of perception. These are my people, and I am among them, but they have chosen the way of the seasons, and will endure."
MarionElder		Necromancer	~kRan er'Hoth says, "These are the dirty teeth which feed the mouth that can not be satiated.  They serve only the Lich and it's nefarious designs."
MarionElder		necromancer amulet	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Do not touch these things!  Even the slightest contact with them could be harmful to those who are still among the living."
MarionElder	MOOD_BAD	princess	~kRan er'Hoth says, "She is a witch, so we must not speak her name any more, or she will be able to find a window into our souls. Shhh, child."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	princess	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Prestidigitation. Do you know what that means? It means sleight-of-hand. That's as far as the princess gets, believe me, with this business about ~Imagic~I and supporting ~Imagic~I. She supports magic with about the same veracity and comprehension as a stone pedestal supporting the Book of Knowledge. She is a dabbler, and will not survive; for the schools of magic demand a serious toll, not the fawning preoccupation of a sophomoric lightweight. Beware the magics, child. They will corrupt to their own ends, and eventually destroy."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	princess	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Princess. A female member of the royal family; the consort of a prince. Family. A group of persons related by blood or marriage; a group of things with common characteristics. Blood. Kinship; temperament; life; lifeblood; bloodshed; murder."
MarionElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	qor	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Speak not that name within my presence, for you do not understand the power of the words your voice makes. You must go, now. Search your soul, and think about what you find there."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	queen spider	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The Queen Spider is the nastiest of the lot, and is matriarch for all of the spiders that plague this land. From the middle of her well protected nest she continues to hatch these toxic and vile creatures. But she is extremely powerful, and has taken on many a well-equipped and courageous party. If you can find her, you will be doing all of the land a favor by extinguishing the Queen Spider, chopping her to bits."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	riija	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Here is a fact that you will not learn outside the ravings of an ancient mad man who is afraid of nothing. The truth leads me and you beyond ourselves. When I was a young man and in the time of my father and his father's brothers Riij"
MarionElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD	rugby	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Well, I retired a couple of seasons past, and now I coach the Marion team. Reigning champs."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	shal'ille	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Shal'ille is the path of light and righteousness, and will balance out the darker forces of our nature if we consider Shal'ille daily while we build our lives. It is also the religion of hypocrisy, for it has many false practitioners that hold themselves and others to the impossible standards of its pious teachings as rules of governance, which cannot be achieved. Religious law is meant to function as a series of guidelines for a better life, and not as the law with which we limit our civilization and judge the world around."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL	spider	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Spiders are a deadly adversary, and even those with years of experience in the wilderness of Meridian approach them with caution, for spiders have a deadly bite that can often be poisonous."
MarionElder		sword of the hunt	~kRan er'Hoth says, "They eat souls."
MarionElder		Tendrath	~kRan er'Hoth says, "In his situation, I would have done the same things he did.  It is rumored that the spirit of this man still roams the world beneath the earth.  Seek him out and you will find answers to many questions."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD	tos	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Tos is an ancient city and by all rights should know better, but the city's pride and avarice has gotten the best of its people. They live behind locked doors, the people of Tos."
MarionElder		Venya'cyr	~kRan er'Hoth says, "I have no tolerance or pity for her.  She made decisions that have hurt thousands of people.  Her mistake is still costing you and I today.  And what have we learned?  What good has come from her deeds?  It is too bad she was not destroyed a thousand years ago."
MarionElder		whiskey	~kRan er'Hoth hisses, "~IGive it to me, fool.~I"
MarionElder	MOOD_BAD		~kRan er'Hoth screams, "Aaaaarrrrrgh!! Waterlogged!! Get you gone!!!!!!"
MarionElder	MOOD_BAD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "In another dream the mountains open for the lost orphan, there are people making roads out of music. Then the sky turns dark as a bruise, and instead of being destroyed, cities rise from war. Two cities, each the opposite of another but sharing a common gate. When the sky clears it is white instead of black and blue, but the cities are gone."
MarionElder	MOOD_BAD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "Sing, sung. Rang, rung. Alarm! Alarm!"
MarionElder	MOOD_BAD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "I am The Goblin King."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "Listen. There are others, elders as I am, who yet live and carry in their hearts pieces of the fractured past. Remember their names. Drechx, who seeks. Alzahakar, the Royal Toady, now mad from his magics. The Vulture Bei Naq. And D'xor, remember that name, Afiera D'xor. Where the others have accepted positions of state, D'xor devotes himself to clarity, and to the pursuit of tenable solutions and to philosophy. Find him, speak with him, child. If he will talk to you, listen."
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "What do you seek in the broken ravings of a madman, child?"
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "What do you have there, child?"
MarionElder	MOOD_GOOD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "You want my wisdom? Ignore the clocks, all of them. You are only playing at their game."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "It is the corruption of age, dear child, nothing more, or less. But still there are things even a lunatic old man can teach you. I have lived my life off the land, a being of peace."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "I saw the night, and there is a great many motions in the sky. You are a fool to be here at all. Go out there now. So I am lost."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "We have no meaningful contact with our great grandmother, who is in the sea. And she is broken-hearted, because where are her children and where are her grandchildren? There are six gods, not four, and her children fight as though given the run of the place, as if we were the rough men. So you look at me like the truth is elusive, but you will see. There is but One Temple, and we are all here, now, child. Now."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "See the corruption of Barloque bubble and froth, boiling and boiling and boiling dry. See the rats come as messengers over the land. The vermin turn out to expose the rotten core, and our ridiculous conceptions of nobility. NOBILITY. We so feverishly thrust it upon others but cannot find within ourselves. Is that something that you would like to explain to a child, or a foreigner? Am I getting through to you?"
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "The poison of the demented forests does exist, an abomination of nature!! Traveling among the twisted beasts there is a toxin lethal to man, which burns through your blood and weakens your will."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "WHAT SKELETONS!?! Skeletons now!?! SKELETONS IN MARION!!??!!"
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "In my dream there is a room at the end of a long hallway, and the room is considerable, gross, surrounded by bars like a cage is. Like a cage that the people in Cor Noth use to keep songbirds, and there are stones with men's faces, and a little girl who surrounds herself with lies."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "Hmmmm... "
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "Blank. Blank blank blank blank blank."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "And so it goes, and so it goes. On and on, into infantile absurdity."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "My mind is torn, maybe like a broken web. Strand here, strand there. These days, they fall over themselves and lay piled up around the corners of this shack. Flotsam, debris, unkind things. Look around yourself, child. See what you'll find?"
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "I have another dream where a magician makes everyone blind. We cannot see, but must feel our way around, families are separated, bonds shattered, and everywhere we find each other to be strangers. What once was our lives, everything is unfamiliar. We spend all of our time hiding beneath the roots of a gigantic tree."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "Come closer. Let me look at you."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "Another dream, now. The sea begins to cough, and shakes the land into six pieces, and when the water leaves, the people follow it back and I am alone amongst the islands. There is a great walled fortress, and from the top I can see a vast wilderness that stretches away in every direction. My father appears, and we follow the rest of the people into the sea."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "Rotten apples. Rotten, wormy apples, full of holes... "
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "DON'T RIP ME OFF. Do you understand that? Do you? DON'T RIP ME OFF."
MarionElder	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kRan er'Hoth says, "I can change."
MarionElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "I AM STILL LOOKING!!! CAN'T YOU SEE I'M STILL LOOKING!?!"
MarionElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "Your head's too small. Freak of nature."
MarionElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "Another dream. In this one, a baboon-faced warrior held a bloody fist high in the air, and I moved forward towards him with curiosity, gliding. He didn't seem to see me. I looked in his fist, and he was clutching a perfect seraphym gem, and his lips were moving. He repeated this over and over; 'Use the gem to capture the souls of the beaten enemy, damning them to eternal agony', and I knew at that moment that this is true."
MarionElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRan er'Hoth starts shuddering violently and spits out an insect. "Yuck," he says.
MarionElder	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kRan er'Hoth says, "If you're stupid and vain enough to attack the Lupogg King, find some others as stupid as you are, and hopefully as vain, and take their sorry carcasses with you. No warrior can take him alone, whether with magic or weaponcraft."
MarionElder			~k~ISomething flutters in the darkness of the hut. A bird, perhaps, a piece of parchment.~I
MarionElder			~k~IThis hut smells like somebody built a bonfire out of cinnamon and dirty socks.~I
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth appears to be dozing.
MarionElder			~k~IYou hear a scritch-scratch sound on the roof, like little feet.~I
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth seems lost in thought.

MarionHealer		ivory chapel	~kLady Aftyn says, "Merchant-knaves have but stolen it, and desecrated the place by letting it to groups of any belief or following, as though it were but a market stall or a farmers' barn! 'Tis is a great shame on our Lady of Compassion and Her Most Benign Ways. But there is remedy yet. We at The Blessed Sanctuary of Gentle Rains endeavor to raise the money, if need be, to buy back the property for the Guild Master Frular of Barloque."

MarionHealer		medei	~kLady Aftyn says, "'Tis a false visage of Shal'ille that that man praises, one that he has invented himself. I have had occasion to speak with him thus, but he will not see light of his error nor mend his profane ways. Say you a prayer for him if he is on your mind, for he is lost."

MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "This is a holy house, dedicated to Blessed Shal'ille and to her good works wherein you may find some comfort."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "The continuance of our work here doth require that we ask for charitable donations, however modest, from those that seek our aid and can afford to be generous."

Minstrel	MOOD_BAD		~kParrin says, "I want to be alone now."
Minstrel	MOOD_BAD		~kParrin slumps into a state of artistic ennui and makes sure that everyone knows it.
Minstrel	MOOD_BAD		~kParrin broods and looks miserable.
Minstrel	MOOD_BAD		~kParrin says, "Look, you think it'd easy being a musician? Pouring out my soul to you people day after day, night after night, struggling with every artistic fiber in my being to reach you, to get inside you a tenderly pluck some chord or some memory? WELL, IT'S NOT!!! I don't know if I can take this anymore! You're bumming me out."
Minstrel	MOOD_BAD		~kParrin visibly sulks.
Minstrel	MOOD_BAD		~kParrin sings, "~IQ is a mighty creator of lands, more than half of these were made by his mighty mighty hands, and when Zjiria says Yay, he says a mighty Nay, and saves us from her wackiest of plans.~I"
Minstrel	MOOD_BAD		~kParrin says, "I am a tortured soul! Cannot you people see that?"
Minstrel	MOOD_BAD		~kParrin sighs heavily and does his best petulant sneer.
Minstrel	MOOD_GOOD		~kParrin sings a truly beautiful a cappella hymn in a haunting language that is foreign to your ear. It sounds something like this. "~IHa na oka-chi, ha na hey, jan-do apas-i, apas-i wa apas-i wa, ha na hey... "
Minstrel	MOOD_GOOD		~kParrin says, "I know a couple of ~Ichoice~I songs about Akardius, but I have to be careful about where and when I sing them."
Minstrel	MOOD_GOOD		~kParrin says, "We both know that satire is sacred, and that no one should hold themselves above humorous comment. Nevertheless, there are some thin-skinned people around here that might get downright uptight over the latest song I wrote about the Princess."
Minstrel	MOOD_GOOD		~kParrin says, "I... well, I LOVE the world!! I do!! I just LOVE you, big old world!!!"
Minstrel	MOOD_GOOD		~kParrin screams, "Yeeeeee, haw!!"
Minstrel	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kParrin sings, "~IJala, Jala, beloved Jala, I can't find a word that rhymes with Jala! Jala, Jala, glorious Jala, I could sing all day if your name was Fay! I'd sing let's stay and pray and we'll be okay, and your glorious song would be a glorious ray, I'd sing well what the hay forget the pay and every day would be Jala day~I!"
Minstrel	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kParrin warbles, "~IWay up in Barloque, one day the sewers did choke, and spit rats out all over like loogies! Now they skitter around, in the forests and towns, and kill the occasional newbie! Oh, the Barloque Rats, the Barloque Rats, where are the Marion Cats? Oh, the Barloque Rats, the Barloque Rats, where are the Marion Cats?~I"
Minstrel	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kParrin twitters, "~ILong ago, in days of yore, the year was three-fifteen, Tos and Barloque went to war, to settle the difference between! Was it over land, or the right to rule, or who won the big chess game? No one remembers why they started the war, but they're still fighting it just the same! Just the same, just the same, just the same, just the same, they're still fighting it just the same! Just the same, just the same, just the same, just the same, though the reasons don't pertain!~I"
Minstrel	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kParrin suddenly bursts into song, "~IWogga wogga wogga wheeee, wogga wogga wogga wogga! Wheeee wogga wheeeeeee wogga woggawoggawogga! Wheeeeeeeeeeee!~I"
Minstrel	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kParrin looks around hopefully.
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin croons, "~IOh, have you heard the story of the lonely Yeti, who lives off in his icy cave, his hair is all nappy like white confetti, and he waits to send weaklings to their grave!

Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin trills, "~IIf I were an Orc, I wouldn't get to eat the Feast Hall pork, yes if I were an Orc, the Duke wouldn't let me in! And if I were a Troll, I wouldn't have Skivlat to keep my bankroll, yes if I were a Troll, the Duke wouldn't let me in! Because the Duke doesn't like monsters at his parties, in his bank or wandering Tos, yes the Duke won't have them over for drinks, and everyone knows that the Duke's the boss~I!"
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin says, "You've got a face for show business!"
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin says, "I want everyone to hold their applause until I finish the song, please."
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin says, "And for my next number... "
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin sings, "~IWell the Tos Arena's five leagues long, doo dah, doo dah... ~I"
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin tries his best to do a primitive tap dance. It's kind of pathetic.
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin Aragone hums a few bars of something or other, trying to remember the words.
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin Aragone whistles a sea shanty.
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin Aragone dances a little jig.
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin sings, "~IThe PKer's took my baby away, and she is here no more, I'm a-going up to the Barloque Sewers, to even up the score. I'm hunting PKer's today, I'm hunting PKer's today, I'm going to find that red named so-and-so and I'm going to make him pay.~I"
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin croons, "~IThe song of the fungus beast is wooo, wooo, wooo! The song of the fungus beast is wooo, wooo, wooo!

Yes we all have to live with the fungus beast, and the fungus beast, and the fungus beast just wants to be free!~I"
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kParrin sings, "~IThrough the forest, through the forest, looking for the Spider Queen! Underground and all around, when I find her I'll stab her in the spleen! She's got treasure, ooooh, yeah! Treasure treasure ooooh, yeah! Whooo, we'll be rich, we'll be so rich, we'll retire and hang out at Fams!

Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kParrin says, "Ah, the life of a celebrity."
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kParrin says, "Naturally, I have an artistic temperament. I am... prone to creative rages, and fits of fancy."
Minstrel	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kParrin obviously doesn't have much sense of rhythm.
Minstrel			~kParrin Aragone gingerly plucks at his lyre.
Minstrel			~kParrin Aragone struggles to tune his lyre.
OneCouncilor		barloque	~kAlzahakar says, "Barloque is an exquisite city. In my days as a fledgling wizard, I maintained residence within her grand walls. It was expensive, but my mastery of magic allowed me with means by which to live there."
OneCouncilor		brax	~kAlzahakar says, "It was to be the greatest seat of culture that the meridian had ever known.  They were a strong, organized peoples who suffered from self-righteousness and nobility.  Very dangerous for a city."
OneCouncilor		bye	~kAlzahakar says, "May the gods see no reason to destroy you."
OneCouncilor		cor NOTH	~kAlzahakar says, "How many nights did I burn a candle to the base studying at the University in Cor Noth? The scholarly atmosphere was most conducive to higher learning."
OneCouncilor		council	~kAlzahakar says, "The King has personally appointed me, his oldest friend and ally, as the head of the council of five. Together we will break the secrets of the tokens and perhaps use them to mend the ancient Meridian."
OneCouncilor		duke	~kAlzahakar says, "I find that I am torn when placing my vote. Akardius is new, yet quite capable."
OneCouncilor		explain	~kAlzahakar says, "The ancient Nexus of power connected this land to the former empire. Long ago, the Nexus snapped and nearly destroyed this world. The five tokens are the magical key to reconstructing the nexus. However, the theoretical new Nexus would not necessarily connect back to the empire of old. Who can truly say what could be in store for us?"
OneCouncilor	MOOD_NOT_GOOD	fey	~kAlzahakar says, "The spells of some disciplines require dedication to certain moral alignments. The fey are useful in changing that alignment quickly. "
OneCouncilor		hello	~kAlzahakar says, "Greetings, my little friend."
OneCouncilor		Hunter	~kAlzahakar says, "They are the children of Tendrath the mage.  Their swords give them a great power to wield, but it also demands a sacrifice which might seem brutal to some."
OneCouncilor		hunter 	~kAlzahakar says, "The hunter has sworn eternal vengeance against the necromancers and all those who take the lives of the innocent.  To know that the hunters are on your trail is to know fear."
OneCouncilor		jasper	~kAlzahakar says, "Jasper, isn't that where Jonas lead his little rebellion too?."
OneCouncilor		King of brax	~kAlzahakar says, "A misshapen man whose deformity always made his kingship suspect.  He lived in a time when people believed that the king represented the spirit of a nation.  Are things so different now?  The people did not want to see deformity."
OneCouncilor		lich	~kAlzahakar says, "The lich is the transformed soul of the ancient queen of Brax.  Her name was Venya'cyr.  She was tempted by these ancient forces.  They used her own noble desires to corrupt her."
OneCouncilor		lich	~kAlzahakar says, "I believe that Venya'cyr can never die.  That is the curse.  The more she uses these ancient powers the less of the noble queen survives.  Perhaps by now she is complete in her vileness."
OneCouncilor		marion	~kAlzahakar says, "Marion enjoys the protection of the goddess Shal'ille. It is a very peaceful place to study."
OneCouncilor		necromancer amulet	~kAlzahakar says, "The necromancer amulet is worn by all who directly serve the Lich.  They are a mouth with which the Lich can feed.  All those who die by the hand of a necromancer feed the hunger of the Lich."
OneCouncilor		princess	~kAlzahakar says, "Ah, the fair and clever Princess Kateriina, she will one day make a beautiful queen and powerful sorceress. She is wise to spend her time in support of the magical arts."
OneCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kAlzahakar says, "Tendrath forged the magical swords to slay the Lich.  The swords were lost to the Lich when the bravest warriors, sent to destroy Venya'cyr, were themselves undone by her power.  The swords are potent against the necromancers but can not kill the Lich."
OneCouncilor		tendrath	~kAlzahakar says, "I know little of him.  His family was killed by Venya'cyr.  It is rumored that his ghost still wanders the land."
OneCouncilor		theory	~kAlzahakar says, "It is my theory that together the tokens could form a powerful bond of magic that would create the Nexus anew. Our problem is we can not seem to get them to stay in one place together long enough to invoke the proper spells and experiments. I could explain further, if you wish."
OneCouncilor		tos	~kAlzahakar says, "Tos has no redeeming value. Even the magic shop owner is a disgrace to the world."
OneCouncilor		Venya'cyr	~kAlzahakar says, "The young princess had a brother.  The brother was King of Brax He was physically deformed and over the years he lost his voice.  The young princess was loved by the people and she performed many of the duties reserved for the king."
OneCouncilor		Zarrus	~kAlzahakar says, "Once a nobleman in the House of Brax, he was the cousin of the Princess Venya'cyr.  He fled the realm for Tos when the Ancient forces guiding Venya'cyr pronounced him a rival for the throne."
OneCouncilor		Zarrus	~kAlzahakar says, "Zarrus is an ancestor of the King Zarcos.  Zarrus was a cousin to Venya'cyr.  It takes no genius to figure out that the Lich, at one time, shared the bloodlines of our King.  I am sure she would like it to be thus again."
OneCouncilor	MOOD_BAD		~kAlzahakar says, "I find Qor's magic to be most potent, don't you? You should master it, her dark shadows are most inviting."
OneCouncilor	MOOD_BAD		~kAlzahakar says, "It is so easy to follow mistress Qor. A little blood spilled here and there, and then you can drink deeply from her power!"
OneCouncilor	MOOD_BAD		~kAlzahakar says, "I sense the forces of evil strongly now. Yes, that wonderful elation that comes with black magic!"
OneCouncilor	MOOD_BAD		~kAlzahakar says, "I feel the dark spirits of Qor growing restless. Leave my home, else I may release them!"
OneCouncilor	MOOD_BAD		~kAlzahakar says, "I have some very important mystical research to do. I trust you can find the door!"
OneCouncilor	MOOD_GOOD		~kAlzahakar says, "Please, warm yourself by my fire."
OneCouncilor	MOOD_GOOD		~kAlzahakar says, "I sense a peacefulness in the continuum. All is well."
OneCouncilor	MOOD_GOOD		~kAlzahakar says, "Clearly Shal'ille's magic ranks stronger than that of the other gods."
OneCouncilor	MOOD_GOOD		~kAlzahakar says, "How serene the world seems when you fully devote yourself to the goddess Shal'ille."
OneCouncilor	MOOD_GOOD		~kAlzahakar says, "The spirit of Shal'ille is with us. A most blessed occurrence."
OneCouncilor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAlzahakar says, "Do not underestimate the raw power of Faren. I've seen many a lesser sorcerer consumed by his own spells when carelessly cast."
OneCouncilor	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kAlzahakar says, "Kraanan is not just a warrior's god. No, his magic is quite potent in directly combating other spells."
OneCouncilor	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kAlzahakar says, "Being a practitioner of all magics, I find the fey of the Vale of Sorrows particularly useful."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "All of us on the council seek the magical tokens so that we may crack their secrets and draw from their power. I have my theories on how this magic can be utilized."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "There are many magical portals open that connect areas that do not sit side by side, or even in the same dimension for that matter. Why even the underworld is know to have such portals."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I am indeed a master of all magic, but the balance I must maintain is too precocious for the common wizard. You are better off staying with one school. If your mind becomes clouded with other schools, I suggest you seek the potion of forgetfulness."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Beware of the magic of Riija, for little of it has any substance. Unless you believe it does, of course."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "All magic comes to us directly from the gods. An atheist is impotent here in Meridian. Perhaps worse off though is someone who tries to appease all of the gods at once."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I do not have time to show you how to get to the various temples, if that's what you are here to ask. Hire a mercenary, there are many that can guide the way."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I have theories on how the tokens function in this dimension and how they can be used in the future."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Priestesses are not the only ones who can teach magic to those willing to learn."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Many people wonder if we still have a king. Indeed, it is so. I, and I alone, speak to him frequently. His highness is... too preoccupied with his studies to be burdened by company or the kingdom."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I can not believe how many minor magicians walk with the pride of a full sorcerer. I pity them should they cross my path."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I do not traffic with the other council members very much. They are not to my tastes, except perhaps Esseldi. At least he has the sense to track down the Mana Nodes. He also has some interesting theories on the Tokens."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Do not put any stock in that wasted wizard Maleval. He is a charlatan, nothing more."
OneCouncilor			~kStrangely, the fireplace does not seem to give off as much heat as you would expect.
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar makes a mystical gesture. You are unsure of what magic he may have just cast.

PrincessLiege		necromancer amulet	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "This hard evidence would surely prove there is more to the old story than I originally thought.  Bring me one of these pendants."
PrincessLiege		necromancer amulet	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Bring me one of these pendants.  It is vital that we have a chance to study such an artifact."

PrincessLiege		Zarrus	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Yes he is one of my oldest ancestors.  One rumor states that when he served in the court of Venya'cyr he had the misfortune of touching a vessel of great corruption.  Many of my family believe that we have been cursed from that day forward."
PrincessLiege	MOOD_BAD		~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Am I not the blood of mine own father? Is he not the King? Although the young Duke is quite intelligent he is still not of the royal line.  I am most displeased."

RebelLiege	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kJonas says, "The state of leadership in this land has become quite shocking when governing is split between the rightful Royal house and some beggard dog dressed in expensive merchant's clothing and calling himself a Duke. I have a mind to seek the crown myself."

RebelLiege	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kJonas says, "If you venture to battle the Lupogg King, then follow this tactical advice for it is sound. Take a large band of warriors to the task, for indeed he has been known to shred five or more with ease. Also, one warrior should lead the attack at a time, retiring as they receive grievous wounds."
RebelLiege	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kJonas says, "When in the face of battle, your first order must be to defend your allies. For your opponents will certainly do so, whether man or beast."

ShalillePriestess		tos	~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bLord Kraanan has many followers in Tos and therefore it must be a great city.~k"
ShalillePriestess		VENYA'CYR	~kPriestess Xiana says, "Without faith in the harmony of all things, we are all more likely to turn towards that which promises the easy solution.  Venya'cyr took the easy path to her desires and it cost her eternal soul."
ShalillePriestess		Zarrus	~kPriestess Xiana says, "If he had not survived, the course of history would surely be different."
ShalillePriestess	MOOD_BAD		~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bI am appalled at the blasphemous things that Miriana says about Shal'ille and Faren. The girl should be flogged. Oh, forgive me, Shal'ille for saying such an awful thing.~k"
ShalillePriestess	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bThe dead should be honored. Placing flowers at a memorial site is more for the spiritual benefit of those living than for the deceased.~k"
ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bThe living trees of Faronath are peaceful beings. They serve Shal'ille.~k"
ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bLittle Miriana speaks lies about our Lady. She is best avoided.~k"

ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bThere is little reason to fear good creatures if you are good yourself.~k"
ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bKilling monsters is far more acceptable than killing other humans. Murder is the fastest way to fall from good graces.~k"
ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bMany do not realize that there is retribution to killing. Often a horrible spirit will manifest and seek revenge for the innocent victim.~k"
ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bThose who are good in nature will be blessed with a gift, should they fall prey to the Underworld.~k"
ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bMastering the teachings of Shal'ille is easier if your mind is cleared of the influences of other gods. A potion of Forgetfulness can aid, but it usually has some ill side effects.~k"
ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bIn Tos, there is an Arena dedicated to our Lady's husband. The fights are mock, so you need not fear death within.~k"

ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bIn the north corner of the temple is the pool of serenity. Bathe in the water and find the peace within you. Take a few moments to release the frustrations of the day and realize you are in this world but to relax. No problem here is worth getting truly wrought over.~k"
ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bIn the south corner of the temple is the pool of redemption. Kneel before it and give forgiveness to your least favored person for they do not mean to truly cause you pain; they just come from a different point of view. Do not hold the weight of a useless grudge or it is you alone who suffers.~k"
ShalillePriestess			~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bSome say I am faulted for acquiescing to the wishes of Kraanan. Men have much strength of hand and must be respected, but the power of Peace and Rebirth lies within the soul of women.~k"

Temples		insignia	~k%NAME's request for an insignia is ignored.
ThreeCouncilor		barloque	~kCylill says, "Barloque is a fairly well defended city. Its walls and moat offer excellent protection to the south, where it needed it in the old Tos wars. But her weakness is in her poorly guarded north shore. A platoon in small boats could shuttle 'round her."
ThreeCouncilor		brax	~kCylill says, "It was to be the greatest military power in the world.  The soldiers of Brax were ferocious warriors and their generals were skilled tacticians."
ThreeCouncilor		bye	~kCylill says, "Cheerio, chap!"
ThreeCouncilor		cor NOTH	~kCylill says, "A rudimentary wall surrounds Cor Noth. She has hardly any military to speak off. And her potential enemies could fully surround her. Very bad design, I say, very bad."
ThreeCouncilor		cort	~kCylill says, "My son, Cort, is the esteemed Watcher of the Arena. His mother helped him get that position. If it were up to me, he'd be going through a proper and rigid stay in the Duke's army right now."
ThreeCouncilor		council	~kCylill says, "Essentially, the council is comprised of myself and four other jolly good chaps. We look after the kingdom in the stead of King Zarcos. Most of the time my peers study these mysterious tokens. I am charged with making sure they don't fall in to the wrong hands."
ThreeCouncilor		duke	~kCylill says, "I hope Akardius can lead troops like Kalior could."
ThreeCouncilor		hello	~kCylill says, "Ho chap!"
ThreeCouncilor		hunter	~kCylill says, "I fear men who serve no visible leader.  They are likely to become vigilantes and then I will have to deal with them.  I do not fear them on a personal level, mind you, I fear their lack of guidance or chain of command."
ThreeCouncilor		jasper	~kCylill says, "Jasper has a good natural defense. There are only a few, very visible ways in and out. A small yet well coordinated task force could repel attackers. If war breaks out, that may be the place to go"
ThreeCouncilor		lich	~kCylill says, "There was supposedly a fortress built with some ancient magic.  The owner of that fortress was the Lich.  Supposedly the castle had a maze that prevented even the largest forces from entering her realm.  Of course the fear of the Urn probably kept most folk from trying."
ThreeCouncilor		marion	~kCylill says, "Marion has the best defense of all the cities, she's protected by a goddess! I say, what could be better than a goddess who makes your enemies sheath their swords. Ha."
ThreeCouncilor		mother	~kCylill says, "Qerti'nya is Cort's mother. She taught me a great deal about our lord Kraanan and about the ways of women. Probably more about the ways of women than I wished to know. She lives way out at the temple beyond the cragged mountains, which is good for her, and bloody good for me."
ThreeCouncilor		necro pendant	~kCylill says, "People who rely on magics such as this are vulnerable in a way that common folk such as ourselves are not.  It would be wise to investigate the nature of their power."
ThreeCouncilor		princess	~kCylill says, "The Princess believes a skilled soldier is better than a strong soldier. Fair logic, I say."
ThreeCouncilor		qerti'nya	~kCylill says, "Qerti'nya is Cort's mother. She taught me a great deal about our lord Kraanan and about the ways of women. Probably more about the ways of women than I wished to know. She lives way out at the temple beyond the cragged mountains, which is good for her, and bloody good for me."
ThreeCouncilor		son	~kCylill says, "My son, Cort, is the esteemed Watcher of the Arena. His mother helped him get that position. If it were up to me, he'd be going through a proper and rigid stay in the Duke's army right now."
ThreeCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kCylill says, "Having seen one in use, I am not so sure there is that much difference between the Hunters and the Necromancers."
ThreeCouncilor		Tendrath	~kCylill says, "Tendrath was a weak man who used his power to destroy an entire city."
ThreeCouncilor		tos	~kCylill says, "Tos is protected by the capable hands of the Honor Guard. The Badlands offered superb protection to the north during the Barloque wars, but now her enemy comes from the south. It will be interesting to see if they can repel a solid siege."
ThreeCouncilor		Urn	~kCylill says, "The Urn was the original source of the Lich's power. It was through the forces of the Urn that Queen Venya'cyr was corrupted."
ThreeCouncilor		venya'cyr	~kCylill says, "She was the sister of a impotent king whom all the folk of the land despised. He was a weak minded man with no training in the field and no knowledge of either diplomacy or warfare."
ThreeCouncilor		watcher	~kCylill says, "My son, Cort, is the esteemed Watcher of the Arena. His mother helped him get that position. If it were up to me, he'd be going through a proper and rigid stay in the Duke's army right now."
ThreeCouncilor		Zarrus	~kCylill says, "I know not of this man."
ThreeCouncilor	MOOD_GOOD		~kCylill says, "Jolly good day, today was, don't you think!"
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "If you really want to know what's what about those beasties out there, you should seek Rook. That chap knows the score."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "The only warrior that's worth his weight has battle scars to brag of. I wouldn't trust a man to defend my castle if he hadn't lived through a really good trouncing or two."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Always remember an army or even a troupe of men is mightier than the single soldier."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Keep an eye out will you for those blasted tokens. I'm in charge of protecting their safety. They are official property of the council, you know."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Did I ever tell you about my underdog strategy in the battle of Ukgoth? The Nasties, or the trolls if you will, had us surrounded. We were thirty men with wounded. They numbered sixty or more. I had my men defend in a cross pattern as our five best flanked their leader. Bloody mess, all in all."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "During my second tour of duty, I found myself and my men faced with ferreting out a small cult of Qor who were randomly picking off our civilians. Those buggers dug them self so deep into the Cragged Mountains with their bloody magic, it took us near five months to give them what for."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Thinking back, it was when our military exercises took us to the Druids Hills when I faced my first troll. Some of the men broke formation. A few of the chaps ran. Not I. I fought side by side with my Sergeant till the bloody beast fell. That's when I knew command was for me."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "I remember when I was promoted to Captain in the Duke's Honor Guard. A small revolution had begun in Jasper. This was back 'round the time of the miner's strike. The whole place was a bloody mess with the scabs returning to the mines and what with all the riots that started up."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Now if I had moved the orange footmen 'round the river to the north... that might have saved some... but then again we needed a force back for the... What? Ho? Are you still here?"
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "You don't come by way of Tos, do you? How's my son doing there?"
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Stand up straight."
ThreeCouncilor			~kThe pleasant scent of raspberries hangs in the air near the source of the river.
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill paces back and forth, muttering something about some long ago war.
TosApothecary		Barloque	~kFrisconar says, "I don't want to talk about Barloque. That city has been nothing but trouble for my love and me."
TosApothecary		buy	~kFrisconar says, "Let me see your reagents. I may buy them if they aren't spoiled."
TosApothecary		bye	~kFrisconar says, "See you again, unless one of us dies first, which is entirely likely to happen in this world."
TosApothecary		cor NOTH	~kFrisconar says, "Cor Noth is a disgusting city. The last time I was there I caught this terrible cold, lasted for months. It's because they aren't sanitary at all there. Why, once I saw a slime floating in their river. Yech!"
TosApothecary		council	~kFrisconar says, "Oh the grand and mighty council. Those has-beens don't know the first thing about government. Seems they're switching their opinion on who should rule every day. They should get jobs."
TosApothecary		cult	~kFrisconar says, "The cults have been plotting against me for years. They think I'm not aware of them, but I know they are out there."
TosApothecary		duke	~kFrisconar says, "I think I can get along with Duke Akardius...At least I hope I can."
TosApothecary		hello	~kFrisconar says, "Do I know you, %NAME?"
TosApothecary		hello	~kFrisconar says, "I thought I wasn't going to see your face in here again, %NAME."
TosApothecary		hello	~kFrisconar says, "What do you want? You're not here to rob me, are you?"
TosApothecary		help	~kFrisconar says, "You need help? Always about what you need, is it. I buy and sell ingredients for spell casting."
TosApothecary		jasper	~kFrisconar says, "Jasper.  That’s a thriving town all right.  Going up against the known ways, just asking for trouble.  It's suicide they're asking for, if you ask me."
TosApothecary		jonas	~kFrisconar says, "Doomed, we’re all doomed, doomed I tell you!!"
TosApothecary		lake	~kFrisconar says, "There's a temple or something down on an underground lake in the dark caves. I wouldn't bother going if I were you. First off, you need a key. And if you do get in, the chill is just miserable."
TosApothecary		love	~kFrisconar says, "The fair Madelia is my true love. She used to live here in Tos when we were together. Then that miserable Frular told her that her cloth shop would do better near Barloque. And the Princess commissioned her to make her royal gowns. The next thing I know my dear Madelia has moved to the Bourgeois Castle. I'm sure she is bewitched by some cruel Riija cult."
TosApothecary		madelia	~kFrisconar says, "The fair Madelia is my true love. She used to live here in Tos when we were together. Then that miserable Frular told her that her cloth shop would do better near Barloque. And the Princess commissioned her to make her royal gowns. The next thing I know my dear Madelia has moved to the Bourgeois Castle. I'm sure she is bewitched by some cruel Riija cult."
TosApothecary		Marion	~kFrisconar says, "I don't see why anyone would want to spend time in Marion. I wouldn't even call it a town. I don't understand why blessed Shal'ille would draper her protection over such a backwater village. And their wise man, ha, I've got more common sense in this thumb."
TosApothecary		paddock	~kFrisconar says, "What, did Paddock tell you to see me? Seems I have to give that thief a commission every time someone mentions his name in here. And he's brought me nothing but trouble."
TosApothecary		princess	~kFrisconar says, "Despite her faults, I'm probably the only one in all of Tos who supports the Princess. "
TosApothecary		rebels	~kFrisconar cries, "What are you waiting for?  It’s rude to keep death waiting.  Do I have a fever, I think I do, this is it, the end, goodbye cruel world.  Aren’t you going to buy anything?"
TosApothecary		sell	~kFrisconar says, "What do think I would sell? This is a magic reagent shop."
TosApothecary		tos	~kFrisconar says, "I really should move from Tos. They say it's the oldest town. That just means it's the drabbest place you'll find. I think the fountain is beginning to smell."
TosApothecary	MOOD_BAD		~kFrisconar says, "What are you so happy about? There's nothing that good going on in the world."
TosApothecary	MOOD_GOOD		~kFrisconar says, "Hard day, %NAME? Aren't they all."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "We used to have a blacksmith in town, until he moved away. I don't blame him wanting to leave this Shal'ille forsaken town. Of course, the town's probably better off without his sort in it. He was an odd one. For some unknown reason, he was interested in buying wands. He was probably part of some cult."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "If you don't want to be part of a school of magic anymore, ask the Priestess for a ~Ipotion of forgetfulness ~I. It will clear your mind of their spells. Of course, drinking it may have bad side effects. I've drunk several of them now. Each one left more than a bad taste in my mouth."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I hear that some people are coming back from another land with knowledge of the forgotten Riija spells. That's just what we need, more spells of deception."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "People don't realize that many of the things they come across can be used by mages to help them cast spells. Maybe that's why my shop is doing so poorly."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "If you have nothing better to do, shop keepers are often looking for someone to run errands for them."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "You haven't been to Barloque recently by any chance, have you? Did you see Madelia? How is she looking? Did she mention me at all?"
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "You know, the watcher only got his position because of some behind the doors deal between the Priestess Qerti'nya and the Duke."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Rycksher's an idiot. For some reason the Duke gave him a job running the bar in the Royal Ballroom. Something's wrong with that. I haven't figured out what the real deal is yet."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I wouldn't trust Skivlat with my money. He loves money just a little too much. He may be part of a cult."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I know some spells. You know I could have been a priest, but all the positions were filled. And the ~Igods~I always pick their favorites to represent them."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Barloque and Jasper really need to do something about their sewers. They are out of control. The rats have run out of breeding room, that's why they are all over. They will probably start spreading the black plague."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "The world is such a crummy place. Monsters run rampant everywhere. I know a spell to protect myself from them, but sooner or later, they'll kill us all. It's only a matter of time."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Ah.. ~Bah.. AH-CHOOOO!!! ~B This cold will be the death of me yet. A few months back, everybody got it. For some reason, I'm the only one who can't shake it off. Always me."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I think I'm coming down with cholera."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I think I'm coming down with rubella."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I think I'm coming down with the consumption. My mother was taken by the consumption."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I think I'm developing a goiter. I think that could be fatal."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "There's that itch again. Knowing my luck, it's probably hives."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Do you smell smoke? Ever since I ate that spicy food at Familiars, my nose has been off. If there is ever a fire, I'll probably die because I won't be able to smell the smoke."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "You don't have any grapes on you, do you? I'm allergic to grapes."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "My throat hurts."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "What are the symptoms of an ulcer? I think I'm coming down with one."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "My feet ache. Oh, how I would like to sit down right now, but my hemorrhoids, you know."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I think I feel nauseous. Is it too warm in here?"
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Ever since I tried that lightning spell, I haven't been able to move my hand as much as I used to."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I have a feeling the weather is going to be just abysmal tomorrow."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I feel awful. I should close up early today."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Are warts contagious? I heard that they were."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I had a dog once. He died of the black rot."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "You aren't sick, are you? I hate being around sick people. They always make it sound worse that it really is."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "What's the difference between scarlet fever and spotted fever. I know I have a fever of some sort."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Don't stand to close to me. You might get infected."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I don't think Madelia is ever coming back to me. Life is so disappointing. You never get what you want. And I have a hard time meeting new women for some reason."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "My hair is falling out. I've only seen thirty winters. I may have leprosy."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Ow. There's that back pain again."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Did you eat at Familiars today? I think I have food poisoning."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Actually, I'm not feeling too bad today."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar coughs and clears his throat. Unsatisfied, he coughs some more.
TosApothecary			~kMassaging his neck, Frisconar lets out a sigh of discomfort.
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar wipes his nose with a well worn rag.
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar lets out a long sigh, then starts scrunching his nose and making a low honking noise.
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar snorts loudly. He says, "Excuse me."
TosBanker		barloque	~kSkivlat says, "They have lots of shillings up in Barloque. They are all rich up there. I don't like Herbutte though. He's snooty. I sometimes ~Iguh~I-trade gems with him. Oh, but you shouldn't. I can give a better deal here for your gems."
TosBanker		buy	~kSkivlat says, "I will buy shillings off of you for a gem or two."
TosBanker		bye	~kSkivlat says, "Good bye %NAME! Come back again. Say hello to who ever you are going to see for me!"
TosBanker		Coin	~kSkivlat pulls out a coin, prepares to flip it, and says, "Heads or Stones?"
TosBanker		cor NOTH	~kSkivlat says, "I don't know how many shillings are in Cor Noth. Probably more than Jasper."
TosBanker		council	~kSkivlat says, "There is one guy in the council I really admire. His name is Bei Naq. He has a lot of shillings. More than anyone else in the world."
TosBanker		duke	~kSkivlat says, "The Duke lives in the Blackstone Keep on the north end of Tos. He has a lot of Shillings because he can collect taxes. I wish I could collect taxes. I also wish he wouldn't collect taxes from me. But over all, he helps lower the cost of items so I can save more of my money. He's nice."
TosBanker		Flip	~kSkivlat pulls out a coin, prepares to flip it, and says, "Heads or Stones?"
TosBanker		guh	~kSkivlat says, "What did you say 'guh' for? You talk funny."
TosBanker		Heads	~kSkivlat flips a shilling in the air, looks at the coin and says, "Heads it is! You're right!"
TosBanker		Heads	~kSkivlat flips a shilling in the air, looks at the coin and says, "Nope, it came up Stones."
TosBanker		Heads	~kSkivlat flips a shilling in the air, looks at the coin and says, "The coin is Heads up! Good call!"

TosBanker		hello	~kSkivlat says, "~IGuh~I-hello, %NAME, how are you on this beautiful %DAYNIGHT!"
TosBanker		help	~kSkivlat says, "I can keep your money safe even if you die. I also know a lot about money. I love money, actually."
TosBanker		interest	~kSkivlat says, "Interest? Your money will be safe in my bank, they won't have children though."
TosBanker		jasper	~kSkivlat says, "I like Jasper. I would live there because it is so close to the mines, but Yevitan already beat me there."
TosBanker		marion	~kSkivlat says, "The people of Marion don't have many shillings. Those poor people."
TosBanker		princess	~kSkivlat says, "The Princess has a lot of money. She's way up near Barloque."
TosBanker		rebels	~kSkivlat spits, "Them rebels, shaking up the balance and all, running amuck, and to think, Yevitan is wasting his own money on them."
TosBanker		sell	~kSkivlat says, "I have some gems to sell. I won't sell shillings though, they are too valuable. Oh, and what would you buy them with? It's kind of like a pair a ducks. When you can only buy one duck with another. Huh huh he he."
TosBanker		sling blade	~kSkivlat says, "I reckon that was a fine picture. ~IUh-huh~I."
TosBanker		Stones	~kSkivlat flips a shilling in the air, looks at the coin and says, "Good ~IGuh~I guess, it is Stones."

TosBanker		Stones	~kSkivlat flips a shilling in the air, looks at the coin and says, "Stones!"
TosBanker		Stones	~kSkivlat flips a shilling in the air, looks at the coin and says, "You can't ~IGuh~I guess them all. It is Heads."

TosBanker		tos	~kSkivlat says, "Tos is a ~Iguh~I-great town to live in."
TosBanker		yevitan	~kSkivlat says, "Yevitan runs the Bank in Jasper. My bank has more money in it so he's jealous. I think he cheats his clients too. He doesn't like me. He's like a, uh, like a creature that wouldn't like me very much. Maybe a troll, they probably don't like me.  Not to mention that he is wasting all his money on those rebels, the fool."
TosBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kSkivlat says, "The Vault's getting a little lonely for my friends. Do you want to deposit some shillings, please?"
TosBanker	MOOD_BAD		~kSkivlat says, "What's going on out in the world? Too many people are withdrawing their shillings. That's not fair, they were so comfortable here with their friends."
TosBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kSkivlat says, "I don't think my ~Iguh~I-vault can hold much more. I might have to rent the room next door for extra storage space."
TosBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kSkivlat says, "I'm so happy. If my bank were, um, a creature that likes to eat a lot, it would be full. I mean because my vault has a lot of ~Iguh~I-money in it right now. Like a troll. They like to eat a lot."
TosBanker	MOOD_GOOD		~kSkivlat says, "I'm not sure why those stupid rats scurry of with shillings. I mean I know why I would ~Iguh~I-scurry off with shillings. But they are so little, what do rats need with money."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "Did you know this coin was made back during the reign of King Zarcos II?"
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "The original official coin of Meridian had a castle on one side and Prince Far'Nohl on the other. You can't find those around anymore."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "Here's a little known fact for ~Iguh~I-you. The Princess depicted on the back of the shilling was Princess Demetia. If she were still alive, she would be 248, uh no, wait, let me think, 249 years old."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "Shillings, my wonderful friends, your golden sparkle never ends. Huh huh he he."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "Most people say money is dirty. Not me, I ~Iguh~I-wash those shillings every day."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat polishes the same coin over and over.
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "I bet you didn't know that shillings aren't pure gold. They have copper and iron in them. Only a small part the coin is true gold."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "I love gems. Not as much as I love shillings. But they are pretty. But not as pretty as shillings."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat counts a stack of shillings. After a few moments, he counts the same stack again.
TosBanker			~kA weird grin crosses Skivlat's face as he shines a few shillings.
TosBanker			~kSkivlat incessantly shakes his pouch of coins. With each metallic clink, his smile broadens. "I love that sound," he says.
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "I love flipping coins. Make a guess, Heads or Stones?"
TosInnKeeper		BARLOqUE	~kPaddock says, "Barloque. It's the most stuck up qordamned city you'll ever see. They think they are the center of power. Ha. They do have the office of the Justicar though."
TosInnKeeper		B'HOB	~kPaddock says, "Zhieu B'hob's a good friend of mine down in Jasper. His general store has all the essentials."
TosInnKeeper		BLACKSMITH	~kPaddock says, "Fehr'loi Qan was our local blacksmith. I think being so close to the graveyard spooked him out of town."
TosInnKeeper		BYE	~kPaddock says, "See you tomorrow, %NAME."
TosInnKeeper		BYE	~kPaddock says, "Aw, get out of here already. Same time tomorrow?"
TosInnKeeper		BYE	~kPaddock says, "See you later. Go kill an Orc."
TosInnKeeper		cor NOTH	~kPaddock says, "Cor Noth is a nice town. We ought to get a clock tower here."
TosInnKeeper		cor NOTH	~kPaddock says, "Cor Noth is a nice town. We ought to get a clock tower here."
TosInnKeeper		COUNCIL	~kPaddock says, "King Zarcos left a council of five men in charge of the land. Well actually they just advise the Duke and Princess. Most of the time they try to figure out those weird tokens. That's government for you."
TosInnKeeper		DUKE	~kPaddock says, "Hail Duke Akardius!"
TosInnKeeper		FEHR'LOI 	~kPaddock says, "Fehr'loi Qan was our local blacksmith. I think being so close to the graveyard spooked him out of town."
TosInnKeeper		FRISCONAR	~kPaddock says, "Frisconar owns the Magic Shop around the corner. Don't get him started on the ills of the world though. You will regret it if you do."
TosInnKeeper		graveyard	~kPaddock says, "I'm a little uneasy about setting up shop so close to the old graveyard. When night falls, the dead pull themselves out of their graves. So far, the people of Tos have been pretty good about keeping them contained, but I'm still uncomfortable."
TosInnKeeper		HELLO	~kPaddock says, "Hail, %NAME!"
TosInnKeeper		HELLO	~kPaddock says, "Welcome to Familiars, the best bar in all of Meridian."
TosInnKeeper		HELLO	~kPaddock says, "Well met traveler, can I get you a brew?"
TosInnKeeper		Izzio	~kPaddock says, "Go look up by Barloque. He knows better than to show his face in or around Tos."
TosInnKeeper		JASPER	~kPaddock says, "I was just in Jasper the other day to pick up some general supplies from Zhieu B’hob. I must say that I am quite impressed with the town's turnaround. Jonas and his rebels might just be doing Jasper some good."
TosInnKeeper		JUSTICAR	~kPaddock says, "Up in Barloque, the common folk can elect their own Justicar to hold trial. The Justicar can pass sentence or pardon law breakers."
TosInnKeeper		KALIOR	~kPaddock says, "Poor, poor Kalior. May he rest in peace."
TosInnKeeper		KATERIINA	~kPaddock says, "Look. There is enough trouble with Trolls, Orcs, and the such. Why stir up more trouble?"
TosInnKeeper		MARION	~kPaddock says, "Marion's a town full of peaceful yokels. A nice place to live, but I wouldn't want to visit there."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	mend	~kPaddock says, "You want a mend, go across the street. I'm sick of those qordamn menders making a profit here and not paying me a percentage. The least they could do is buy a drink now and again."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	mend	~kPaddock says, "For the love of Shal'ille, will you guys go do your mending business across the street."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	mend	~kPaddock says, "I'm going to have to change the name of this place to Familiars Mending Shop. For crying out loud, go do your business across the street."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	mendING	~kPaddock says, "How about this, every time someone gets something mended, they also buy a brew. Otherwise, take your mending across the qordamn street."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	mendING	~kPaddock says, "You know, there is a perfectly good freelanced mending shop across the street."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	need a courier?	~kPaddock says, "I don't need any couriers."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_GOOD	need a courier?	~kPaddock says, "No, %NAME."
TosInnKeeper		need a courier?	~kPaddock says, "Hold on, let me check... nope, no outgoing letters."
TosInnKeeper		need a courier?	~kPaddock says, "Sorry, %NAME, I don't have any letters to be delivered."
TosInnKeeper		need a courier?	~kPaddock says, "I'm working on writing a letter to the council. Come back later after I've finished it."
TosInnKeeper		PRINCESS	~kPaddock says, "I feel Akardius is more fit to rule Meridian than the Princess."
TosInnKeeper		QAN	~kPaddock says, "Fehr'loi Qan was our local blacksmith. I think being so close to the graveyard spooked him out of town."
TosInnKeeper		REBELS	~kPaddock says, "You know this is exactly how the Duke’s family came into power, although they will never admit it."
TosInnKeeper		RYCKSHER	~kPaddock says, "Is my little brother in trouble again? Ever since I got him the job working in the Duke's Banquet Room, he's been nothing but trouble."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	sacriligious path. Embrace nature	~kPaddock yells, "Get the hell out of here, you nature freak!"
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD	sacriligious path. Embrace nature	~kPaddock yells, "Would somebody get that tree-hugger out of here."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD	sacriligious path. Embrace nature	~kPaddock sighs, "Here we go again."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL	sacriligious path. Embrace nature	~kPaddock says, "Oh, for the love of Shal'ille, go someplace else, %NAME! I'm sick of you fanatics."
TosInnKeeper		TOS	~kPaddock says, "Tos is the place to be. It has it all, the Arena of Kraanan, the old city crypt, Blackstone Keep, the best bank in the land, and a great blacksmith. Actually, scratch that, we lost the blacksmith to Barloque."
TosInnKeeper		ZHIEU 	~kPaddock says, "Zhieu B'hob's a good friend of mine down in Jasper. His general store has all the essentials."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kPaddock says, "I was just thinking to myself, maybe I should give brew away for free. You know, just open the keg to the house. It's not like you cheap loafers are going to actually spend money to buy it."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kPaddock says, "It's a wonder I stay in business. So many people come in here. But at the end of the night, my profits don't show it. If people don't start drinking, I should charge a qordamn entrance fee."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_BAD		~kPaddock says, "What's the matter? Is everybody so qordamned cheap, you can't buy a lousy brew?"
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_GOOD		~kPaddock says, "I'm not sure if I should take tomorrow off. Maybe I'll go have Skivlat flip a coin for me. That's what I always do when I've got a simple decision to make."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPaddock says, "If you find yourself in Marion, the best place, well, the only place to take a load off your feet is the Limping Toad Inn. The guy who owns it, Tova, is a pretty funny guy. I think he holds a grudge against me for running a better tavern, though."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_NEUTRAL		~kPaddock says, "Can I get anyone another round of brew?"
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kPaddock says, "Kraanan's Arena is a good place to get better at fighting, but it's no replacement for the real thing. True warriors only get stronger by taking on stronger beasts in the wilds."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kPaddock says, "This is a bar. If you're not going to drink, there's the door."
TosInnKeeper	MOOD_NOT_GOOD		~kPaddock says, "I hear there's a new gambling house in North Barloque. The owners would be making a big mistake if they don't manage it right."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Tos really isn't the oldest place. There's an ancient castle beyond the land of trolls. The old kingdom used to be centered there. Now it's abandoned and some say ~Ihaunted.~I"
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "If you want to know about those qordamned creatures out there, go to Cor Noth. There's this guy named Rook. He knows it all."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Money, they say you can't take it with you when you die. That's what banks are for."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "It's dangerous outside those city walls. If I were you, I'd get myself some traveling companions. There's safety in numbers."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Frisconar says there is an underground lake somewhere around these parts."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Qordamn sewer rats are everywhere nowadays. Good thing they're like baby spiders, easy to squash."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Oh yeah, if you're interested Frisconar teaches a spell or two. Shal'ille, I think. He pays me a commission if I refer business to him."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "It's interesting to see all the different types that frequent my place. Soldiers, masons, bards, and acolytes of the Priestesses bring news. The acolytes usually have interesting stories to tell about their pilgrimages to the temples."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Before I forget, if you need reagents like mushrooms and herbs for your spells, see Frisconar. Let him know I referred you to him."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "I’m surprised that the Councilors haven’t had much to say about Jonas and his new faction."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Our Arena in East Tos is a great place to take a brew and watch a fight. I'm amazed at how good those guys get just practicing in there."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "You look tired. Why don't you pull up a chair, buy a drink, and get some rest. Familiars is one of the best places to recuperate."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "I'm a little uneasy about setting up shop so close to the old graveyard. When night falls, the dead pull themselves out of their graves. So far, the people of Tos have been pretty good about keeping them contained, but I'm still uncomfortable."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "My philosophy is ~Ithe better the customers, the less I need to chew their ear off~I."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock leans behind the bar, cleaning out empty mugs.
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock taps another keg of brew open.
TosWatcher		cylill	~kThe Watcher says, "General Cylill is a member of the Council and he is my father. He resides on the River Ille."
TosWatcher		duke	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail the Memory of Kalior! Hail Duke Akardius!"
TosWatcher		hello	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail %NAME!"
TosWatcher		help	~kThe Watcher says, "I judge all arena matches. Read my banners to learn how to enter."
TosWatcher		kraanan	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail our lord and god, Kraanan of the Fist! Fight in his name, and you will know true strength."
TosWatcher		princess	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail Princess Kateriina!"
TosWatcher		qerti'nya	~kThe Watcher says, "You speak of the Priestess Qerti'nya, my mother. She has taught me discipline and courage. You would be wise to visit her out at the Temple of Kraanan beyond the Cragged Mountains."
TosWatcher		tos	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail Tos, the oldest city in all of Meridian!"
Towns		stunted dwarf	~kThe room goes silent as %NAME mentions stunted dwarf.
TwoCouncilor		barloque	~kBei Naq says, "Barloque is the richest city in the world, and that is why I respect it."
TwoCouncilor		brax	~kBei Naq says, "A lost city whose treasures, should they be found, could prove very profitable for the one who finds them."
TwoCouncilor		bye	~kBei Naq says, "Be off with you, then."
TwoCouncilor		cor noth	~kBei Naq says, "Cor Noth has its value. It lies roughly between the Princess and the Duke. The inn is merely acceptable as a place to stay for the night."
TwoCouncilor		council	~kBei Naq says, "King Zarcos left me, and the other four, in charge of managing the government until his successor is chosen. We have been tasked with studying the priceless tokens."
TwoCouncilor		duke	~kBei Naq says, "My support goes his way on occasion. In fact, generally, I support him. However, the Princess often returns my jeweled token, so I sometimes support her."
TwoCouncilor		hello	~kBei Naq says, "Yes? Why are you here?"
TwoCouncilor		help	~kBei Naq says, "I am one of the five counselors."
TwoCouncilor		Hunter	~kBei Naq says, "I know nothing of these landless zealots."
TwoCouncilor		jasper	~kBei Naq says, "A pox on Jasper! Much of my fortune was made through Jasper's mines, but now they are all dried up. The town should be closed."
TwoCouncilor		lich	~kBei Naq says, "Do I look like a historian to you? I am a simple man, do not ask me about such things."
TwoCouncilor		marion	~kBei Naq says, "No one has any money in Marion. Not worth my attention, I tell you."
TwoCouncilor		methods	~kBei Naq says, "It is rumored that he was a masterful negotiator who always kept his objectivity.  He was a diplomat for hire who had a knack for easing tension and acquiring wealth.  A potent combination wouldn't you say?"
TwoCouncilor		necromancer amulet	~kBei Naq says, "I would very much like to acquire one of these pendants.  I am sure they would be priceless."
TwoCouncilor		princess	~kBei Naq says, "The Princess Kateriina comes from a very rich family. I respect that."
TwoCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kBei Naq says, "I would love to get my hands on one of those swords.  It would certainly be worth a fortune if not priceless."
TwoCouncilor		Tendrath	~kBei Naq says, "Who?"
TwoCouncilor		theories	~kBei Naq says, "Each token is made of the absolute finest of materials, so good in fact that I do not believe they were made by the hands of man. I suspect that they were crafted by gods in a realm beyond Meridian. Each token probably represents a different being of immense power."
TwoCouncilor		tos	~kBei Naq says, "Age does not always mean more value. Tos, for example, seems to get less valuable every year."
TwoCouncilor		value	~kBei Naq says, "The eggs of a giant queen spider are said to have certain value as an aphrodisiac."
TwoCouncilor		Venya'cyr	~kBei Naq says, "I have heard the name but I recall nothing about the person."
TwoCouncilor		Zarrus	~kBei Naq says, "An ancestor of Zarcos.  He began to build the fortune which would later bring his family to power.  I respect his tenacity as well as his methods."
TwoCouncilor	MOOD_BAD		~kBei Naq says, "Who sent you here? What do you want? My gold I'll warrant. Well, you won't be getting it!"
TwoCouncilor	MOOD_BAD		~kBei Naq says, "You look like a thief, come to steal my treasures. Well, you won't get them, I tell you, you won't!"
TwoCouncilor	MOOD_BAD		~kBei Naq says, "Don't even consider robbing me. I can snap my fingers and my personal guards will show you the pointed end of their swords."
TwoCouncilor	MOOD_NOT_BAD		~kBei Naq says, "I often like to play a good game of Feudal Lords with some of my friends up in Barloque. Meidei has the cards behind his bar."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "It is tragic how often we lose sight of the tokens. Simply put, they are priceless. I indeed have my own theories on why they are so valuable."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "I've heard that there is a new queen spider. I would like to get my hands on her eggs. They have certain... value."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "The safest place for your money is in a bank. Unless you have a hidden gem mine to tuck away your fortune, like I do."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "A buyer can be found for most any item, if you look hard enough."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "I hear legend of a mighty gem created by some long dead alchemist buried away near some underground lake."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Those disgusting Trolls are often attracted to shiny things like gems. I'll wager they have stashed a great deal of treasure over the years."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "A good place to store your treasures is up with the vaultman in Barloque."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "The Justicar in Barloque holds trials of murderers. Bah, we've more of a problem with thieves. The Justicar should hear those cases as well."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Thieves, thieves, everywhere. I cannot stomach such miserable wretches."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Do not stand too close to me. And let me see your hands at all times."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Well, what do you want?"
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Wealth of coin or token should not be brought together in a lump in your home. There are better places to hoard your power."
