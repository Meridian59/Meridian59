TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Tos really isn't the oldest place. There's an ancient castle beyond the land of trolls. The old kingdom used to be centered there. Now it's abandoned and some say ~Ihaunted. ~I"
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "If you want to know about those qordamned creatures out there, go to Cor Noth. There's this guy named Rook. He knows it all."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Money, they say you can't take it with you when you die. That's what banks are for."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "It's dangerous outside those city walls. If I were you, I'd get myself some traveling companions. There's safety in numbers."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Frisconar says there is an underground lake somewhere around these parts."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Qordamn sewer rats are everywhere nowadays. Good thing they're like baby spiders, easy to squash."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Oh yeah, if you're interested Frisconar teaches a spell or two. Shal'ille, I think. He pays me a commission if I refer business to him."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "It's interesting to see all the different types that frequent my place. Soldiers, masons, bards, and acolytes of the Priestesses bring news. The acolytes usually have interesting stories to tell about their pilgrimages to the temples."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Before I forget, if you need reagents like mushrooms and herbs for your spells, see Frisconar. Let him know I referred you to him."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "I'm surprised that the Councilors haven't had much to say about Jonas and his new faction."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Our Arena in East Tos is a great place to take a brew and watch a fight. I'm amazed at how good those guys get just practicing in there."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "You look tired. Why don't you pull up a chair, buy a drink and get some rest. Familiars is one of the best places to recuperate."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "I'm a little uneasy about setting up shop so close to the old graveyard. When night falls, the dead pull themselves out of their graves. So far, the people of Tos have been pretty good about keeping them contained, but I'm still uncomfortable."
TosInnKeeper		graveyard	~kPaddock says, "I'm a little uneasy about setting up shop so close to the old graveyard. When night falls, the dead pull themselves out of their graves. So far, the people of Tos have been pretty good about keeping them contained, but I'm still uncomfortable."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Kraanan's Arena is a good place to get better at fighting, but it's no replacement for the real thing. True warriors only get stronger by taking on stronger beasts in the wilds."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "My philosophy is ~Ithe better the customers, the less I need to chew their ear off~I."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "If you find yourself in Marion, the best place, well, the only place to take a load off your feet is the Limping Toad Inn. The guy who owns it, Tova, is a pretty funny guy. I think he holds a grudge against me for running a better tavern though."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "Can I get anyone another round of brew?"
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "I was just thinking to myself, maybe I should give brew away for free. You know, just open the keg to the house. It's not like you cheap loafers are going to actually spend money to buy it."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "It's a wonder I stay in business. So many people come in here. But at the end of the night, my profits don't show it. If people don't start drinking, I should charge a qordamn entrance fee."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "This is a bar. If you're not going to drink, there's the door."
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock says, "What's the matter? Is everybody so qordamned cheap, you can't buy a lousy brew?"
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock leans behind the bar, cleaning out empty mugs.
TosInnKeeper			~kPaddock taps another keg of brew open.
TosInnKeeper		HELLO	~kPaddock says, "Hail, %NAME!"
TosInnKeeper		HELLO	~kPaddock says, "Welcome to Familiars, the best bar in all of Meridian."
TosInnKeeper		HELLO	~kPaddock says, "Well met traveler, can I get you a brew?"
TosInnKeeper		BYE	~kPaddock says, "See you tomorrow, %NAME."
TosInnKeeper		BYE	~kPaddock says, "Aw, get out of here already. Same time tomorrow?"
TosInnKeeper		BYE	~kPaddock says, "See you later. Go kill an Orc."
TosInnKeeper		BARLOqUE	~kPaddock says, "Barloque. It's the most stuck up qordamned city you'll ever see. They think they are the center of power. Ha. They do have the office of the Justicar though."
TosInnKeeper		cor NOTH	~kPaddock says, "Cor Noth is a nice town. We ought to get a clock tower here."
TosInnKeeper		JASPER	~kPaddock says, "I was just in Jasper the other day to pick up some general supplies from Zhieu B'hob.  I must say that I am quite impressed with the towns turnaround.  Jonas and his rebels might just be doing Jasper some good."
TosInnKeeper		MARION	~kPaddock says, "Marion's a town full to peaceful yokels. A nice place to live, but I won't want to visit there."
TosInnKeeper		TOS	~kPaddock says, "Tos is the place to be. It has it all, the Arena of Kraanan, the old city crypt, Blackstone Keep, the best bank in the land, and a great blacksmith. Actually, scratch that, we lost the blacksmith to Barloque."
TosInnKeeper		DUKE	~kPaddock says, "Hail Duke Akardius!"
TosInnKeeper		KALIOR	~kPaddock says, "Poor, poor Kalior. May he rest in peace."
TosInnKeeper		PRINCESS	~kPaddock says, "I feel Akardius is more fit to rule Meridian than the Princess."
TosInnKeeper		REBELS	~kPaddock says, You know this is exactly how the Duke's family came into power, although they will never admit it."
TosInnKeeper		KATERIINA	~kPaddock says, "Look. There is enough trouble with Trolls, Orcs, and the such. Why stir up more trouble?"
TosInnKeeper		COUNCIL	~kPaddock says, "King Zarcos left a council of five men in charge of the land. Well actually they just advise the Duke and Princess. Most of the time they try to figure out those weird tokens. That's government for you."
TosInnKeeper		FRISCONAR	~kPaddock says, "Frisconar owns the Magic Shop around the corner. Don't get him started on the ills of the world though. You will regret it if you do."
TosInnKeeper		BLACKSMITH	~kPaddock says, "Fehr'loi Qan was our local blacksmith. I think being so close to the graveyard spooked him out of town."
TosInnKeeper		FEHR'LOI 	~kPaddock says, "Fehr'loi Qan was our local blacksmith. I think being so close to the graveyard spooked him out of town."
TosInnKeeper		ZHIEU 	~kPaddock says, "Zhieu B'hob's a good friend of mine down in Jasper. His general store has all the essentials."
TosInnKeeper		JUSTICAR	~kPaddock says, "Up in Barloque, the common folk can elect their own Justicar to hold trial. The Justicar can pass sentence or pardon law breakers."
TosInnKeeper		RYCKSHER	~kPaddock says, "Is my little brother in trouble again? Ever since I got him the job working in the Duke's Banquet Room, he's been nothing but trouble."
TosInnKeeper		B'HOB	~kPaddock says, "Zhieu B'hob's a good friend of mine down in Jasper. His general store has all the essentials."
TosInnKeeper		QAN	~kPaddock says, "Fehr'loi Qan was our local blacksmith. I think being so close to the graveyard spooked him out of town."
TosInnKeeper		cor NOTH	~kPaddock says, "Cor Noth is a nice town. We ought to get a clock tower here."
KocatanApothecary		Hello	~kZala ix'Mecya takes a puff from her pipe and says, "Hey, welcome to my shop. Can I get you something?"
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "Whoa, I forgot you were here. Did I help you yet?"
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "You're not from Ko'catan, I can see that now. Can I ask why you traveled all this way?"
KocatanApothecary		ko'catan	~kZala says, "Well that's where you are, man."
KocatanApothecary		goodbye	~kZala says, "Hey, stop back in sometime, okay?"
KocatanApothecary			~kZala sorts through a pile of green herbs. She carelessly tosses the dead brown ones to the floor.
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "I hope there are not too many spices in this brew."
KocatanApothecary		help	~kZala ix'Mecya says, "I run this magic shop. If you are in need of herbs or reagents for your mystic rituals, I'm the woman to talk to."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala seems to forget you are here and begins to meditate.
KocatanBartender		Hello	~kOxal ix'Tokak looks you over with a disapproving glare and says, "What do you want?"
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "My opinion is that the Ix'ca spend far too much time in here during the day. If I were the ranking officer or the Captain of the Day Guard I would keep all the soldiers so busy that they wouldn't have time to drink wine."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "If not for the bad luck of losing my arm at Balo na'te Din, I would have been a ranking officer by now."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "If this military isn't vigilant, those Avar'ot would mount an attack and ravage Ko'catan. We are that close to extinction here."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "If I were in charge of the Kici'ca, we'd be taking the fight to the Avar! Hu a'ach!"
KocatanBartender		Avar	~kOxal says, "It is said that there were two tribes of those bird men. That is talk for diplomats, cha'ya, and old merchants past closing time. That is not talk for Ix'ca. To Ix'ca there is only one kind of avar, and that is avar'ot."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal carefully wipes a glass with a colorfully printed towel.
KocatanBartender		help	~kOxal ix'Tokak says, "I am here to serve as a bartender. That is all. Do you want a drink or not?"
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Be fair warned, death awaits those who go into the jungle unprepared. It might take your arm and leave you a half soldier, as it has with me."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "You aren't one of those spell casting imbeciles, are you? I cannot trust ritual witches, like Zala and her lot."
KocatanBartender		Zala	~kOxal says, "Zala ix'Mecya has a shop on up towards the wall. She sells herbs and things for making magic. I don't trust anyone who makes their living from wizardry and nonsense hocus pocus."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Are you going to buy a drink or just stand there with your mouth open?"
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "This hall has been here for almost two hundred years. It was set up by the Kici'ca, and it is here even now mostly for the Kici'ca. You are here as a guest of the Ko'catani Kici'ca. "
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "I left the Kici'ca when my arm was separated from me."
KocatanBartender		sell	~kOxal says, "I sell pekonch, atz pekonch, and if you want to order get in line."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Most foreigners can't grasp the simple rules of pronunciation. For example, take the letter 'X'. A true member of Ko'catan starts the letter at the back of the throat as if about to spit. The sound ends up like 'sh' in your word 'wish'."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Let me teach you how to properly pronounce our 'O's. Tense your tongue and round your lips in a tight circle. 'O's are always long and stressed in a word. Such that our 'Ot' sounds like your 'coat'."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Always stress the first syllable in any Ko'catan word. In addition, put an equal amount of stress on an syllable that immediately follows an apostrophe. Ko'catan is KO - CAtan."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "I'm the only one in town who has the skill necessary to teach language. By all accounts, I should be Quetzal ko'Atezya."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "You are pronouncing our 'E' wrong. Make it softer and bring it to the front of your mouth. We say 'get' not 'git', 'geet' or 'gat'."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Our 'A's are almost always soft and long as in 'balm'. Relax your tongue more and widen your lips. That's it."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "I don't understand most of your people's names. They don't seem to have very much structure."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "I also know a bit of Avar speak, but not enough to properly teach it. If you really want to talk with those creatures, you should seek Franz zax'Ak."
KocatanLanguageMaster		hello	~kQuetzal says, "Greetings, %NAME, that's an interesting name you have. What is its origins?"
KocatanLanguageMaster		konima	~kQuetzal says, "Yeah, Konima was a great warrior who fought the orcs, but he hardly founded this society. Our language and culture came out of a lost group of ruffians thirsting for civilization in a most inhospitable region."
KocatanLanguageMaster		ko'catan	~kQuetzal snidely remarks, "Ko'catan literally means 'master warriors fortification'. It just screams how primitive our society is. It may as well be called 'dumb bullies hideout'."
KocatanLanguageMaster		avar	~kQuetzal says, "The bird people are smart enough to form a semi-coherent language, but that hardly makes them civilized."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "You know... never mind, I shouldn't say... well, all right, since we're friends. I know of a group of prospectors who have located an emerald mine. The claim hasn't been made official yet, so there is still time to invest in the mining operation. If you give me 12,000 shillings, we can quadruple it in two weeks time."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "I'm thinking of opening a second inn on the mainland. Just imagine, the authentic feel of Ko'catan right in the middle of Cor Nogg. Tell you what, since I like you, I'll let you invest 25,000 shillings. With it you would own one quarter of the inn and its profits."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "Have you bet on the warriors Tourney yet? I have inside knowledge that the champion is going to lose. If you want in, the odds pay 67 to 1. Guaranteed win. Give me 500 shillings and I'll place the bet for you."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "Come here. Do you want to make big money? I'm involved in a group where the profits are enormous. Here's how it works, as a new member you pay me 1,000 shillings. Now the next twenty new members pay you 1,000 shillings each. You will be rich in no time."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "Last chance to enter the raffle for the nerudite bow! Only 500 shillings to enter. Winner announced tomorrow."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "How much money do you have on you? I have a bit of property I need to unload today. It's a small villa on the other side of the island. The area is a bit dangerous, but it's good property and I'm willing to part with it for only 100,000 shillings."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "I have secret knowledge that there will soon be a shortage of brew. I've stockpiled a couple of barrels away. If you want, I'll hold them here until the shortage begins, but you can be the owner of them for only 900 shillings. Think about it, you'll be able to charge any price you want for a cup of brew."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal cheerfully smiles at you.
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal happily sings an old folk song to himself.
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal smiles and says, "Today is a great day, don't you think?"
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal counts a large stack of coins, giggling to himself.
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says to himself, "Where am I going get 450,000 shillings? I am such a dead man. Riija help me, I'm such a dead man."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal sweats profusely and says, "Xacal ko'Ixca didn't send you did he? If he did, let him know I ~Ihave~I his money. Well, I mean I will have his money tomorrow."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal paces back and forth nervously as if awaiting some disaster.
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says to himself, "What am I going to do?! There is no way I can come up with that much money."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal wipes tears from his eyes while muttering something about losing a lot of money.
KocatanInnKeeper		hello	~kMoxal ix'Hanak greets you with, "Hello, %NAME! You're just in time. Any later and you would have missed out on some great deals."
KocatanInnKeeper		bye	~kMoxal says, "So long, %NAME! May all of your journeys be profitable."
KocatanInnKeeper		konima	~kMoxal says, "Konima was the greatest hero and entrepreneur this society has ever known. I wish I was around to get in on his expedition in its start up."
KocatanInnKeeper		ko'catan	~kMoxal says, "This is the greatest society mankind has ever known. But maybe someday I'll leave Ko'catan to see what the old cities have to offer."
KocatanInnKeeper		Riija	~kMoxal says, "Riija is a fine upstanding god. He doesn't deserve the bad reputation some people give him."
KocatanInnKeeper		Avar	~kMoxal says, "Unfortunately, our culture has had a lot of misunderstandings with the Avars. Once matters are cleared up, they are going to be great culture to take from, I mean, trade with."
KocatanInnKeeper		teach	~kMoxal says, "I'm afraid I'm not allowed to teach anything yet."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "This wasn't really an inn before people from your land started coming here. Long ago it was built to house the Avar ambassadors. Well, after the treaties fell apart, this mainly got used by soldiers who, well, let's just say, didn't feel like sleeping in their barracks."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "This is a wonderful place to stay the night. Don't let the noise from downstairs bother you. It usually quiets down around midnight."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kYou hear shouting and laughter coming from the tavern beneath here.
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "So how long have you been in the settlement? You must love it here. I know I do."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "Business has really started booming since your people started coming here. In fact, I only need a few more masters to sponsor me and I'll move up a rank."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kA loud crash from downstairs startles you. Presumably used to such sounds, Moxal pays no attention to it.
KocatanLanguageMaster		help	~kQuetzal says, "I'm easily the most intelligent person in this settlement. I know all about Language Structure, History, and Philosophy. I can even teach simpletons to speak Ko'catanese fluently."
KocatanLanguageMaster		buy	~kQuetzal says, "I have a few things here I could sell you."
KocatanLanguageMaster		sell	~kQuetzal says, "Do you have any books or scrolls?"
KocatanBanker		bye	~kHuital says, "Good day to you. Your valuables will be safe with us."
KocatanWeaponsMaster		hello	~kKochtal ko'Tulca says, "Hello? Who's there?"
KocatanWeaponsMaster		help	~kKochtal ko'Tulca says, "I am the foremost weapons master in Ko'catan. Those who show proper warrior respect, I teach."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "In Ko'catan, our people must earn their names. One does not chose to ascend to cha or ko. Others will decide that for them."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Our culture has many established customs and mores. We do not hesitate to outcast those who can not adhere to them."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Every person has a purpose and a defined rank here. We allow you in our walls. Do not presume to disrupt the order of Ko'catan."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "There is no art of war. War is the antithesis of art. Those who find beauty in war have never seen in a battle."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Skilled at weaponry makes a soldier competent. To be truly formidable, the warrior must also have patience, forethought and allies."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "You must have compassion. A cold hearted warrior is less effective than one who cares, for they have nothing worthwhile to lose."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Our society has survived for over 200 years based on one principal--'structure'. With no structure, there is only chaos."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "You offend our settlement. You would be wise to leave."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Ko'catan does not desire your people here."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Long ago, your people and our people were one. Now we are different. Our societies no longer belong together."
KocatanWeaponsMaster		CUSTOMS	~kKochtal says, "Our society is built on respect for those who rank above you. As foreigners, you rank under an ix and therefore must respect all in our society."
KocatanWeaponsMaster		MORES	~kKochtal says, "Every person is judged on their worth to our warrior society. People here know the boundaries of their vocations."
KocatanWeaponsMaster		konima	~kKochtal says, "Konima was the perfect warrior. Not just a killing machine, but also a compassionate and unselfish strategist. Our society is founded on his brave ideals."
KocatanWeaponsMaster		KO'CATAN	~kKochtal says, "Ko'catan is a great and orderly fortification. She offers protection and purpose to her inhabitants."
KocatanWeaponsMaster		SELL	~kKochtal says, "I may be able to train you in the ways of archery."
KocatanWeaponsMaster		BUY	~kKochtal says, "Ko'catan provides for all of my needs."
KocatanWeaponsMaster		TEACH	~kKochtal says, "I may be able to train you in the ways of archery."
KocatanWeaponsMaster		Avar	~kKochtal says, "The Avar are very precise and sturdy opponents. Tread lightly though their homelands or bring an army with you."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Many years ago I lost my eyes defending the outer walls. I am of little use as a warrior now. That is why I must teach."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "I sense you are respected in your land. That is good, friend."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "I have heard praise of you from another traveler. Be proud."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal feels your face and your shoulders. Smiling, he says, "I will remember you."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal sniffs the air and says, "The warriors have returned from a hunt."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal cranes his neck as if listening intently. You hear nothing. After a moment he smiles and says, "She won't find him at the tavern."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal begins a slow routine of stretching and bending.
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal gropes around for his weapons. After a moment, his hands find an old, rusted short sword. He whispers, "There you are, old friend."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "As I hear, your land has little structure. The Kingdom is divided and the towns in conflict. Ko'catan does not need such influence."
KocatanLanguageMaster		teach	~kQuetzal says, "Stay here and listen to me. I'll help you learn our language."
KocatanBanker		Hello	~kHuital ko'Nosak says, "Welcome traveler. How can I or my brother, Itzal, help you today?"
KocatanBanker		konima	~kHuital says, "Hail to Konima. May his legend live on."
KocatanBanker		Ko'catan	~kHuital says, "We are fortunate to be part of such an advanced society here. You must be impressed." Itzal rolls his eyes and grunts."
KocatanBanker		Riija	~kHuital says, "Beware of the power of Riija. Many say it is mere trickery, but in diabolical hands, great wrongs can be done."
KocatanBanker		Avar	~kHuital says, "This island may not have enough room for three warlike tribes to peacefully coexist. We must be prepared for the inevitable war for dominance."
KocatanBanker		sell	~kHuital says, "You are mistaken, we are not merchants."
KocatanBanker		buy	~kHuital says, "You will find the Neglected Arsenal on the west side of Ko'catan. Pacal ix'Anoak may wish to buy your wares."
KocatanBanker		teach	~kHuital says, "I have already taken on my fill of apprentices for this season."
KocatanBanker		help	~kHuital says, "My brother Itzal can safely store a number of your items. I manage the bank. I have provided signs to explain how to use our establishment."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "We have not yet set up an official trade route with the old world. Money and items you store here can not be accessed in your home land."
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal stares blankly at the wall and belches repeatedly.
KocatanBanker			~kHuital rinses his hands off in the pool of water before beginning the next transaction.
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "I am not yet certain of the ramifications of the influx of old world traders. I'm keeping a close eye on the moneys in my bank though. I do not want to see Ko'catan enter an age of inflation."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "We had little need of a monetary system before the foreigners arrived. Most people bartered and worked for their needs."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "Where do you accumulate all of this wealth?"
KocatanBanker			~kHuital smiles at you and says, "It is refreshing to see your people in our land."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital frowns while looking over a tablet. He says, "I'm worried that these shillings you import could disrupt our economy."
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal scratches his backside.
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "You don't want me to go ~Iback~k down that vault to retrieve something, do you?!"
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "Hey Huital, can I take a break? My legs are tired."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "Honestly Itzal, you need to work on your posture."
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal's eyes flutter closed and his mouth hangs open. In a few seconds, he begins snoring.
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "~BItzal!~B ~IWake up, we have customers here.~I"
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "Huital, I need some extra money. I accidentally broke one of the customer's flasks."
KocatanBanker		broke	~kHuital says, "~IAgain?!~I"
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal places his hands in the water and splashes his face. Huital gives him a scathing glare.
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "You are a bit overdressed for our hot climate."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says to you, "Where did your people learn social graces? Rather, when ~Iwill~I they?!"
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal swats at a buzzing fly.
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "Thank you for coming in our Vaults, good %SIRMADAM.", then whispers to Huital, "Was that all right?"
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal sighs and says, "Not you again."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "It is good to see you, %NAME."
KocatanVaultman			~kYou are suddenly confronted by a very unpleasant odor. Itzal smiles to himself.
KocatanBanker			~kHuital smiles, seeming content with the day's events.
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "Excuse me. Shouldn't have eaten at the Monster today."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital waves his hand at the water pedestal and says, "Please, it is our custom to wash our hands before doing business to represent a clean deal."
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "I'm tired, Huit. Let me go home early tonight."
KocatanVaultman			~kItzal says, "I think I lost some of Ixla's armor pieces. I hope she doesn't hurt me for it."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "Itzal, you desperately need to organize your vault. The customers have been more than patient waiting for you to find their valuables."
KocatanBanker			~kHuital says, "You may want to leave your money and many of your items here before you go off into the jungle. It can be fairly dangerous this time of year."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "There's a lot of Guilds around here. Frular, down the street, he makes 'em official like."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I didn't like having m' shop across the, uh, street from that graveyard. Every night, I would hear such a ruckus. But Kraanan protected me from the zombies."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I wasn't scared of nothin' dead. That's not why I left Tos."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "If you want to try out these weapons, take 'em down to Tos. The Arena of Kraanan's a good place to practice. Nobody really gets hurt there."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "If you're bored, people 'round here usually have an errand or two, if you're willin' to work."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "Some weapons are better for fightin' certain monsters than others, y'know."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I once went to the, uh, temple of Kraanan. It's hard to get to. I got lost a couple times near that ancient place with the stones."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "Do you follow Kraanan the Fist? He's the strongest god."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I, uh, still don't know many people in town. Rycksher always had good gossip 'bout everybody in Tos. I don't know no nothin' 'bout Barloque."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "The ocean air smells so good up here. I should go out for a cool swim before I get back to the forge."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I don't like being here. Every morning, that bad fish smell."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "Anything else I can help you with? I got to get on with my work."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "Oh, it's good to be alive."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "You're my friend."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I'm glad you are here. I don't like those strangers that come in to my shop."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I'm happier up here in Barloque, ain't you?"
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I'm gettin' mad now. You better leave before I give you a good punch."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "Don't look at me that way. I'll take you outside and give you a good bruisin'."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "Are you makin' fun of me? I don't like people makin' fun of me and I'm bigger than you."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "Stop hangin' around m' shop, little person, or I'll give you what for."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I don't like strangers hangin' around my shop."
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "What are you lookin' at? You wantin' to fight me?"
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan carefully examines a half finished hammer.
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan mumbles a short prayer to Kraanan.
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kWiping the sweat from his brow, Fehr'loi Qan returns to his work.
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kYour eyes sting slightly from the soot in the air.
BarloqueBlacksmith			~kThe heat from the furnace makes it uncomfortably warm in here.

BarloqueBlacksmith		Jasper	~kFehr'loi Qan says, "Quintor's the smith in Jasper.  He was my friend a long time ago, but then his wife left him and he hasn't been, uh, the same since.  I hear he found himself a friend though, I think the name was Queasy, or something."
BarloqueBlacksmith		Marion	~kFehr'loi Qan says, "Colhorr's up in Marion. We go drinking once a month and talk about, well, makin' weapons and stuff."
BarloqueBlacksmith		Tos	~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I left Tos. I got m' reasons."
BarloqueBlacksmith		Duke	~kFehr'loi Qan says, "It is a shame to hear of Kalior's demise. I hope that Duke Akardius does not raise the taxes."
BarloqueBlacksmith		Princess	~kFehr'loi Qan says, "The Princess is a nice lady. She uh...has lots to do."
BarloqueBlacksmith		jonas	~kFehr'loi Qan, Well I don't know much about politics and the like, but I do know that Jonas could never make a fairer ruler than Princess Kateriina."

GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "I grow weary of dealing with fledgling guilds of little intention. I tell thee truly, I have canceled more than one charter in my time."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "There are many ways to take possession of a Hall from another guild. But thou must be patient, cunning and determined, indeed. So many believe they possess said talents, but only the best succeed."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Take care in who thou asks to join thy guild. I've heard many a tale of new members outnumbering the old and ousting the master in favor of their own."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "A sad thing is those lonely men who hath true belief they can take the world by themselves. A man who hath no allies shall prosper nary a whit."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Yon globe is for established Guild Masters to post their charter or to appeal for more members."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Mayhaps, plenty of guild halls would be well received. Yet I do find the treaty breaking and subterfuge to be more interesting drama."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "I care not how a guild comes to possess my halls, only that they are kind enough to pay the rent."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "How fickle the boons of friendship. Friends make thee stronger. Yet, friends make thee more vulnerable as well."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "'Tis a sad guild that has but one or two members. In truth, I will traffic not with them and will endeavor to revoke the charter."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "At the castle, thou will find fair Madelia. I take her to be sweet and supple. A most entertaining hostess is she. I protest unto thee, speak not to mine wife about these words."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "I grow weary of dealing with the petty squabbling of these guilds. For certain, their bickering only serves to profit me, but mayhap more money is worth not the pains mine ears endure when they whine like babes."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Let me tell thee in hushed tones, ~I I believe that popinjay Herbutte spends his idle hours listening through yon wall."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Hm. My book shows me an error in a certain guild's charter. I've half a mind to revoke them."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Mayhaps, I should retire and buy this city for myself and buy Cor Noth for the fair Madelia... How Now! How long hast thou been standing there?"
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "Can life become better than 'tis now? Guilds abound and mine profits soar to the sky above."
GuildCreator			~kFrular says, "I am a very busy man. Seat thyself and wait or seek to come back at another time."
GuildCreator			~kThrough the western wall, you can hear the muffled sound of someone yelling. You can't quite make out what is said.
GuildCreator			~kFrular flips through his book, casually checking that the guild charters are in proper order.
GuildCreator			~kOn the floor behind Frular, you can see a spool of fine golden thread.
GuildCreator		hello	~kFrular says, "Hail , %NAME!"
GuildCreator		bye	~kFrular says, "Fare thee well."
GuildCreator		help	~kFrular says, "If thou wish to make thy guild official, then thou shouldst buy a title from me. I maintain the records on Guild Halls."
GuildCreator		buy	~kFrular says, "I need not buy from peddlers."
GuildCreator		sell	~kFrular says, "I rent the finest guilds halls in the land."
GuildCreator		barloque	~kFrular says, "Barloque doth house a favored hall of mine. The Hall of Explorers lies 'round the eastern corner here in south Barloque."
GuildCreator		cor NOTH	~kFrular says, "'Twas King Zarcos IV, who demanded the priest's temple exist not within the walls of the cities. I could not let that abandoned Shal'ille temple go to ruin in the middle of Cor Noth. A fine guild hall it has made."
GuildCreator		Jasper	~kFrular says, "No more bizarre town is there than yonder Jasper. What tales I could tell thee about Jaarba's Abode and the Wryn's Keep!"
GuildCreator		marion	~kFrular says, "I hold no leases in Marion. They tolerate not the troubles that guilds bring forth."
GuildCreator		tos	~kFrular says, "For centuries, Konima's Dwelling lay vacant in Tos awaiting the hero's return. I was only granted lease of said property with the clause that should Konima himself ask for it back, the building would be immediately emptied and the keys presented to him."
GuildCreator		duke	~kFrular says, "Even under Akardius, my halls are safe from search and seizure."
GuildCreator		princess	~kFrular says, "Hail the Princess. It is through her grace that I am able to lease these halls. Yet, in truth, the Princess doth tax me too much."
GuildCreator		council	~kFrular says, "I have more than enough politics with mine chartered guilds and truly care not for the council's state affairs."
GuildCreator		jaarba	~kFrular says, "Jaarba had paranoia in great measure. Before his affliction of insanity, he housed a small group of rebels. His abode is most unique in its maze layout."
GuildCreator		wryn	~kFrular says, "In days of yore, the mayor of Jasper sought to extract himself from the sovereignty of the crown. He had dug a great keep within the south mines, a perfect palace to hole up in  the event of siege. No war came about. The King knew that the Mayor would eventually lose his fire as the mine's gold was depleted. I found it to be a rather reasonable lease from the town."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "I won't traffic with those vanishing tokens. In faith, even the council knows not why they teleport out to the wilds."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "The clepsydra keeps perfect time. 'Tis a pity the dreary rabble knows not how to read it."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "No better place is there than Barloque. Mayhaps there be no worse place than the foul docks and sewers."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "By my troth, we've no rat problem. 'Tis but rumors spread by the lesser cities."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "Madelia is naught but a lightskirt. Were she not the only clothier of merit, she would surely be selling something else by the docks."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "Frular deals in guild halls in the thin walled building beside me. Mine ears know quite a few stories of his clientele."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "Vermin infest our streets, and no, I speak not of rats. I refer to the new residents, that groundling Fehr'loi Qan and that candlewaster Pritchett."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "To the south east, the Bourgeois Castle foliage blooms beautifully this time of year. 'Tis a magnificent palace befitting of our proud Kateriina."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "Mine ears hath discerned from these shallow walls that [random guildmaster] leads [guild he leads]."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "No reason do I see for ever setting foot outside of Barloque, except perchance to pay visit to the glorious Castle of her Highness."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "Alas, this world brims with inadequate drumble. How I long to have words with a civilized gentleman of the proper class."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "Astounded am I at the utter incompetence abound in this world. Take for example, that drumble Solomon, hath thou ever set eyes upon another man who wears his belly so far from his back."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "Perchance, wouldst thou have thy gems appraised, good gentle?"
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "How may I be of service to thee?"
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "Doth thou smell that sea air? Verily, 'tis refreshing. Thou wilt find it not quite so hale in any other city."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte says, "Wilt thou buy nothing more?! Thy useless countenance merely wastes space in my shop."
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte casts a withering glance at you.
BarloqueMerchant			~kA slight sneer comes to Herbutte's lips as he looks you over.
BarloqueMerchant			~kHerbutte cranes his head slightly as if listening to the eastern wall.
BarloqueMerchant		hello	~kHerbutte says, "Good morrow."
BarloqueMerchant		bye	~kHerbutte says, "To thee, Anon."
BarloqueMerchant		barloque	~kHerbutte says, "Barloque is the only city worthy of attention. The others are but barnyards for the common cattle."
BarloqueMerchant		cor NOTH	~kHerbutte says, "Promise had Cor Noth as an offspring of grand Barloque, yet those young students add only waste to her river and sully her fine streets. Its clock tower is a common sundial compared to our fair clepsydra."
BarloqueMerchant		jasper	~kHerbutte says, "Jasper hath but one value, the gems her mines produce."
BarloqueMerchant		marion	~kHerbutte says, "Thou jests. Marion is not a town of any stature."
BarloqueMerchant		tos	~kHerbutte says, "I have not been to a more disagreeable spot than Tos. The city streets doth run rampant with the most unworthy of cretins."
BarloqueMerchant		duke	~kHerbutte says, "Mayhap with the Duke out of the way, the Princess can take her rightful crown."
BarloqueMerchant		princess	~kHerbutte says, "On my allegiance, the Princess Kateriina be worthy to rule. She hath been properly bred for such, unlike that villainous Duke."
BarloqueMerchant		jonas	~kHerbutte says, I just don't see what he hopes to gain by this, it's not like they will ever let him have a title of his own, besides traitor."
BarloqueMerchant		council	~kHerbutte says, "The council fill their cups with more than what's offered. They should let the Princess rule the land and return to the level of Advisors."
BarloqueMerchant		sell	~kHerbutte says, "I presume thou hast gold enough to view my gems."
BarloqueMerchant		buy	~kHerbutte says, "I offer fair values for thy gems and jewels. Mind you, I have quite an eye for flaws."
BarloqueMerchant		tokens	~kHerbutte says, "The tokens be fascinating magical objects the council seeks to study. If thou ever happens upon one, seek ye the council and rewarded wilt thou be."
BarloqueMerchant		rat	~kHerbutte says, "Rat!?" Herbutte jumps back, "Oh no! Where be it?"
BarloqueMerchant		clepsydra	~kHerbutte says, "The clepsydra in the center of North Barloque is a clock. I presume thou are not so simple that thou can read it not."
BarloqueMerchant		rabble	~kHerbutte says, "The poor, of course. Only here in Barloque can thou truly find worthwhile gentlefolk."
BarloqueMerchant		stories	~kHerbutte says, "What doth thou think of me? I shall not tell thee Frular's secrets!"
BarloqueMerchant		stories	~kHerbutte says, "I am of no mood to talk of my fair neighbor's dealings."
BarloqueMerchant		help	~kHerbutte says, "I am Meridian's first most jeweler. If thou hath gems to sell or if thou hath need of jewels, then I am at thy service. If not, then find ye the door behind thee."
BarloqueMerchant		pritchett	~kHerbutte says, "Pritchett doth belong elsewhere. His common tongue hath no control over the proper speak of Barloque. He doth create his own language."
BarloqueMerchant		jewel	~kHerbutte says, "I am the only fair dealer. Seek not Skivlat for a lowly axwaddle is he."
BarloqueMerchant		gem	~kHerbutte says, "I am the only fair dealer. Seek not Skivlat for a lowly axwaddle is he."
BarloqueMerchant		skivlat	~kHerbutte says, "I am the only fair dealer. Seek not Skivlat for a lowly axwaddle is he."
BarloqueMerchant		axwaddle	~kHerbutte says, "An axwaddle is a lazy person, you uncouth drumble."
BarloqueMerchant		drumble	~kHerbutte says, "Dost thou speak the language not? A drumble is a sluggish haskard."
BarloqueMerchant		haskard	~kHerbutte says, "My word, never have I seen such a haskard as thee. A haskard is a fellow of low degree."
BarloqueMerchant		fellow	~kHerbutte says, "Thou mockest me now!"
BarloqueMerchant		degree	~kHerbutte says, "Thou mockest me now!"
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "Were thou ever to find thyself near the mysterious stone circle that lies deep beyond the cragged mountains, and if thou possess tenacity in great measure, then, as I understand and breathe, thou will find means to the center and to the magic source within."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "How now! Curious enough, our fledgling neighbor blacksmith who hath recently removed himself and his shop likewise from yonder Tos, has a most peculiar fascination with magical wands. I know not wherefore he collects them."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "Dost thou know that some mushrooms found in the wild can grant sustenance to those who consume them. 'Tis truly a wonder the different types of magics such foliage can deliver, be it as reagents or food stock."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "Learning the magic of the different gods be like treating thyself to a vast meal. Some foods, thou will find, do not go together. And oft, thou must cleanse thy palette before moving on to another entree. Like a fine dry wine, there are potions that can cleanse thy mind of unwanted learning."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "I beseech thee, allow it into my knowledge if thou doth feel warm in greater measure than pleases thy body. I would to keep the temperatures to the level of expectation required by my precious greenery within. Or if thy find comfort in such extreme warmth, mayhap I could one day teach thee the magic of heat."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "No greater waste hath occurred than frivolous discarding of valued spell reagents by those who hath no awareness of their true value to those who practice acts of sorcery."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "To the south of our beauteous city and deep within the Badlands, the Faren priestess doth reside. I take her to be high spirited and a pure ally to the breadth of nature, yet be fair warned the woman hath a temper seen not in the careful bounds of simple civilization."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "If thou art weary in thy feet, tongue twisted Pritchett doth host a pleasant inn across from mine shop. 'Tis true, indeed."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "I know not why the ships sail no more."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "Ah, I find nothing more intriguing than the wondrous nature of the reagents, how little they are, yet how big. Alas, I could spend all of my days here studying them."
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "Nature hath spawned many a plant and rock, more indeed than one can put to numbers. 'Tis mine own belief that each pebble and every twig doth hold some essence of power that we will one day tap and put to use in our spell crafting."
BarloqueApothecary		echo	~kA woman's voice calls from the other room, "Joguer, bring thyself hither! Thy dinner will be ice before it sees the likes of thee."
BarloqueApothecary		echo	~kA woman's voice yells from the other room, "~BJoguer, dost thou listen to me not? 'Tis thrice I have called thee now. Attend to me. Joguer?"

BarloqueApothecary		night	~kA woman irately calls from the other room, "~BJoguer! Get thee to bed. I'll stay awake no more waiting for thee to shut thy bauble shop!"
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "Can I help thee to find a certain herb or mushroom?"
BarloqueApothecary			~kJoguer says, "Hm. Interesting indeed that the elderberries of the early season behold smaller and more jagged leaves than the those late comers of autumn."
BarloqueApothecary		emote	~kJoguer hums to himself, oblivious of your presence.
BarloqueApothecary		hello	~kJoguer says, "Ah, my gentle friend, how good it is to see thy countenance once again."
BarloqueApothecary		hello	~kJoguer says, "Ah, %LORDLADY, how good it is to see thy countenance once again."
BarloqueApothecary		bye	~kJoguer says, "Must thou make such haste in thy departure? I shall be sorry to see thee go."
BarloqueApothecary		bye	~kJoguer says, "Must thou make such haste in thy departure? I shall be sorry to see thee go."
BarloqueApothecary		barloque	~kJoguer says, "Such a fine city is our fair capital Barloque. The other cities can offer not the wonders of hither shop keepers."

BarloqueApothecary		jasper	~kJoguer says, "Thou will never find a more skilled artisan of stone than the man in Jasper who owns the hands of Afiera D'xor."
BarloqueApothecary		marion	~kJoguer says, "The most fertile of soil can be found near yonder Marion."
BarloqueApothecary		tos	~kJoguer nods his head and half smiles when Tos is mentioned. It is obvious that he is refraining from voicing his opinions on the town.
BarloqueApothecary		duke	~kJoguer says, "Thou should understand that the death of the Duke is a bane. His nephew, even more incompetent than Kalior has taken the reigns of power."
BarloqueApothecary		princess	~kJoguer says, "May the Princess have the strength to combat this new threat, Akardius."
BarloqueApothecary		jonas	~kJoguer says, Well I don't pay much attention to all of them politics, but I don't see anything wrong with what Jonas has done."
BarloqueApothecary		council	~kJoguer says, "The council doth rule the land in the absence of our King."
BarloqueApothecary		help	~kJoguer says, "As the foremost expert and sage on herbs, roots, berries, mushrooms and other tidbits of foliage, I am humbly at thy service. By my troth, I can even teach a trick or two."
BarloqueApothecary		trick	~kJoguer says, "Mayhaps, thou could learn how to warm the air from one such as me. Or if thou has my favor, I will consider teaching thee how to fade clear of sight."
BarloqueApothecary		teach	~kJoguer says, "Mayhaps, thou could learn how to warm the air from one such as me. Or if thou has my favor, I will consider teaching thee how to fade clear of sight."
BarloqueApothecary		sell	~kJoguer says, "I sell the finest herbs and roots."
BarloqueApothecary		buy	~kJoguer says, "In faith, I grow most of mine own stock. There is little that thou could offer me that I have need of."
BarloqueApothecary		potions	~kJoguer says, "'Tis my believe that the priestesses produce potions that cleanse the mind of spells. Be fair warned, quaffing such oft comes with a high price."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "If thou hath shillings in great measure, they would be safe in a bank, but they would be better served if given to charity in the name of Shal'ille. If thou give them to me, I will distribute them to the poor for thee."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Seek thee Rook for lore of the vile monsters that plague our land. After falling from grace of the Princess, I believe he hath moved to Cor Noth."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "If thou are intent on fighting, start with the rats. They are easy and overpopulated."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "The Priestess Xiana can instruct thee on the spells of blessed Shal'ille."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Seek thee the temple of Shal'ille and pray for redemption! It lies in the deep woods of Ileria, north of Marion."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Gems and herbs can oft be employed to work magic. I pray thee, use them only for the will of Shal'ille."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Rest and eat in here rather than on the road. 'Tis best for thy body. Also for thy soul, for I will tell thee of blessed Shal'ille."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Others will say that battling opponents more potent than thee will make thy body stronger. While this be true, combat is not the way to salvation. Only through the peaceful teachings of Shal'ille can thou find thyself content!"
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "If thou ask me, I believe those tokens cursed. Bring them not before me. Surely for some wicked reason, the council wishes to study them."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Thou appears weighed down by equipment. Thou may wish to seek the Vaultman here in Barloque, or better yet give thy items to the needy in the name of Shal'ille."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Beware the Cragged Mountains, they hide the vile temple of Qor and her sinful servants!"
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Ran er'Hoth be the Wise Man of Marion. He is versed in the ways of Shal'ille and mayhap can teach thee her magic."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "I am told there is a man in Tos who teaches a spell of blessed Shal'ille. I know not his name."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "The Priestess Xiana can learn thee more of the scriptures of Shal'ille. Thou must take pilgrimage to her one day!"
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Forsooth, the servants of Qor brings forth those horrid rats from the deep sewers to plague our lands."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Thou seems of gentle sort. Know this, a node of good magic lies in the vale of the fey."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Praise Shal'ille the Calm! May she bid thee good health!"
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Shal'ille blesses thee."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Shal'ille, I pray thee bless the children and the poor."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Lady Shal'ille, prithee bless those who come to my establishment and eat from my kitchens and drink from my kegs, bless those who follow the Princess, bless those who embrace your gentle bosom, bless those who refuse you for they know not what they do, bless the rats in hopes that they will become your servants of good, bless my family."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Lady Shal'ille, I pray thee bless the farmers in the fields, bless the builders who give us shelter, bless the trees that give us shade, bless the rivers that give us water, bless the Guides that help us in our travels and bless the Guardians for smiting us not."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Praise Shal'ille the Gentle! Study thou her ways!"
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Follow her peaceful ways, and Shal'ille will bless thee."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "I beg thy pardon, fair customer... . ~I Shal'ille, prithee bring peace to the countryside... .~I Now what can I get for thee?"
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "If thou refuses the litany of Shal'ille, thou will surely perish and be damned to Qor!"
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "Bow thyself down before Shal'ille and beg for her forgiveness!"
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei ignores you as he silently prays.
BarloqueBartender			~kBowing his head, Meidei silently mouths a prayer to Shal'ille.
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei glares at you with fire in his eyes and says, "Pray tell, dost thou follow the ways of Shal'ille?"
BarloqueBartender		hello	~kMeidei says, "Welcome and praise Shal'ille."
BarloqueBartender		bye	~kMeidei says, "May Shal'ille guide thee to righteousness."
BarloqueBartender		barloque	~kMeidei says, "Barloque be the capital city. Once she has properly embraced the bosom of Shal'ille, she will be able to truly bring the kingdom to peace."
BarloqueBartender		cor NOTH	~kMeidei says, "A horrid city is Cor Noth. The University strays from the teachings of Shal'ille and the inhabitants are wanton atheists. What's worse, the ivory chapel of Shal'ille hath been soiled by deviant guilds."
BarloqueBartender		jasper	~kMeidei says, "I once thought those of Jasper should take to farming. All that is produced now are these blasted rebels and criminals. Mayhap the Justicar should pay them a visit."
BarloqueBartender		marion	~kMeidei says, "Marion is a peaceful and loving town under the caring guidance of good Shal'ille, praise be her name."
BarloqueBartender		tos	~kMeidei says, "Tos lies beyond the badlands to the south. May Shal'ille protect thee if thou wish to travel to her wicked walls."
BarloqueBartender		duke	~kMeidei says, "A new pox has formed in Tos."
BarloqueBartender		kalior	~kMeidei says, "The mighty wicked has fallen."

BarloqueBartender		kateriina	~kMeidei says, "With the tutelage of Xiana, Kateriina is growing into a fine and compassionate woman."
BarloqueBartender		council	~kMeidei says, "The five appointed councilors are sure to be wondering if their jobs are in jeopardy. I know not where they are right now. Mayhap Pritchett knows their whereabouts."
BarloqueBartender		help	~kMeidei says, "I tend the bar, sell food, and pledge myself to the goddess Shal'ille."

BarloqueInnKeeper		tides	~kPritchett says, "Aye, it hath become to dangerous to sail in those unpredictable tides. They rip your ship apart faster than you can spit. It 'tis as if the gods themselves do be wanting man to sail beyond the coastal waters."

BarloqueVaultman			~kObert says, "Alas, poor Pritchett doth try badly to masque as a native of Barloque. Mayhap, someone need teach the knave how to speak properly. His tongue doth create words which make sense not."
BarloqueVaultman			~kObert says, "I pray thee, be on thy guard in hither docks. A magnificent city is Barloque, but not so much in that it hath not a bad side."
BarloqueVaultman			~kObert says, "If thou hast need of a bank to store thy shillings, I would suggest a journey to the First Royal Bank of Jasper."

BarloqueVaultman			~kObert says, "With nary a ship in port in over a score of years, I found myself easily in the means of acquiring these unused warehouses. And that proved most wise on the part of me, for now nearly every soul in the land comes to fill my buildings with their collectibles."
BarloqueVaultman			~kObert says, "'Tis true enough, I do own the lot of these warehouses. Alas, save one. The guildhall on the west side. A rowdy bunch are they and not likely to give up their space to me or any one besides me for that matter."

BarloqueVaultman			~kObert says, "How now! What's the matter?"

BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "Dost thou belong to a guild? Frular, the guild creator, is a ~Ivery good ~Ifriend of mine."
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "The Brownstone Inn is a perfect place to settle down for the night. If thou sees dear Pritchett within, I pray thee, tell him that I have forgotten not our plans to dine together."
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "Oh dear Pritchett, he tries in such great measure to blend with the nobility. If only he could properly learn the tongue of Barloque as I have. In faith, I do love him."
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "I do believe that Frular is the most handsome man in all of the kingdom. Perchance, thou were sent not to me by his wife?"
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "I dread the thought of going back to Tos. 'Twas a most ugly affair when I left Frisconar."
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "In faith, 'tis difficult not to speak in the manner befitting the nobles of Barloque. Thou must only know when to use thees, thous, thys and wherefores. Try it and thou will see how easy it is."
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "I am without purple mushrooms. 'Tis time to make nice to that simpkin Frisconar."
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "Thou should always have an excess of quality apparel. And a healthy variety for thy every occasion."

BarloqueTailor		tos	~kMadelia says, "I pray thee, speak not of Tos. Her lights are far behind me."

TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "We used to have a blacksmith in town, until he moved away. I don't blame him wanting to leave this Shal'ille forsaken town. Of course, the town's probably better off without his sort in it. He was an odd one. For some unknown reason, he was interested in buying wands. He was probably part of some cult."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "If you don't want to be part of a school of magic anymore, ask the Priestess for a ~Ipotion of forgetfulness ~I. It will clear your mind of their spells. Of course, drinking it may have bad side effects. I've drunk several of them now. Each one left more than a bad taste in my mouth."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I hear that some people are coming back from another land with knowledge of the forgotten Riija spells. That's just what we need, more spells of deception."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "People don't realize that many of the things they come across can be used by mages to help them cast spells. Maybe that's why my shop is doing so poorly."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "If you have nothing better to do, shop keepers are often looking for someone to run errands for them."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Hard day, %NAME? Aren't they all."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "What are you so happy about? There's nothing that good going on in the world."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "You haven't been to Barloque recently by any chance, have you? Did you see Madelia? How is she looking? Did she mention me at all?"
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "You know, the watcher only got his position because of some behind the doors deal between the Priestess Qerti'nya and the Duke."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Rycksher's an idiot. For some reason the Duke gave him a job running the bar in the Royal Ballroom. Something's wrong with that. I haven't figured out what the real deal is yet."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I wouldn't trust Skivlat with my money. He loves money just a little too much. He may be part of a cult."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I know some spells. You know I could have been a priest, but all the positions were filled. And the ~Igods~I always pick their favorites to represent them."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Barloque and Jasper really need to do something about their sewers. They are out of control. The rats have run out of breeding room, that's why they are all over. They will probably start spreading the black plague."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "The world is such a crummy place. Monsters run rampant everywhere. I know a spell to protect myself from them, but sooner or later, they'll kill us all. It's only a matter of time."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Ah.. ~Bah.. AH_CHOOOO!!! ~B This cold will be the death of me yet. A few months back, everybody got it. For some reason, I'm the only one who can't shake it off. Always me."

TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I think I'm developing a goiter. I think that could be fatal."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "There's that itch again. Knowing my luck, it's probably hives."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Do you smell smoke? Ever since I ate that spicy food at Familiars, my nose has been off. If there is ever a fire, I'll probably die because I won't be able to smell the smoke."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "You don't have any grapes on you, do you? I'm allergic to grapes."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "My throat hurts."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "What are the symptoms of an ulcer? I think I'm coming down with one."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "My feet ache. Oh, how I would like to sit down right now, but my hemorrhoids, you know."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I think I feel nauseous. Is it too warm in here?"
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Ever since I tried that lightning spell, I haven't been able to move my hand as much as I used to."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I have a feeling the weather is going to be just abysmal tomorrow."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I feel awful. I should close up early today."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Are warts contagious? I heard that they were."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I had a dog once. He died of the black rot."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "You aren't sick, are you? I hate being around sick people. They always make it sound worse that it really is."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "What's the difference between scarlet fever and spotted fever. I know I have a fever of some sort."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Don't stand to close to me. You might get infected."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "I don't think Madelia is ever coming back to me. Life is so disappointing. You never get what you want. And I have a hard time meeting new women for some reason."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "My hair is falling out. I've only seen thirty winters. I may have leprosy."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Ow. There's that back pain again."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Did you eat at Familiars today? I think I have food poisoning."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar says, "Actually, I'm not feeling too bad today."
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar coughs and clears his throat. Unsatisfied, he coughs some more."
TosApothecary			~kMassaging his neck, Frisconar lets out a sigh of discomfort.
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar wipes his nose with a well worn rag.
TosApothecary			~kFrisconar lets out a long sigh, then starts scrunching his nose and making a low honking noise.

TosApothecary		Barloque	~kFrisconar says, "I don't want to talk about Barloque. That city has been nothing but trouble for my love and me."
TosApothecary		cor NOTH	~kFrisconar says, "Cor Noth is a disgusting city. The last time I was there I caught this terrible cold, lasted for months. It's because they aren't sanitary at all there. Why, once I saw a slime floating in their river. Yech!"
TosApothecary		jasper	~kFrisconar says, "Jasper.  That's a thriving town all right.  Going up against the known ways, just asking for trouble.  It's suicide thier asking for, if you ask me."
TosApothecary		Marion	~kFrisconar says, "I don't see why anyone would want to spend time in Marion. I wouldn't even call it a town. I don't understand why blessed Shal'ille would draper her protection over such a backwater village. And their wise man, ha, I've got more common sense in this thumb."
TosApothecary		tos	~kFrisconar says, "I really should move from Tos. They say it's the oldest town. That just means it's the drabbest place you'll find. I think the fountain is beginning to smell."
TosApothecary		duke	~kFrisconar says, "I think I can get along with Duke Akardius...At least I hope I can."
TosApothecary		princess	~kFrisconar says, "Despite her faults, I'm probably the only one in all of Tos who supports the Princess. "
TosApothecary		jonas	~kFrisconar says, Doomed, we're all doomed, doomed I tell you!!"
TosApothecary		rebels	~kFrisconar cries, What are you waiting for?  It's rude to keep death waiting.  Do I have a fever, I think I do, this is it, the end, goodbye cruel world.  Aren't you going to buy anything?"
TosApothecary		council	~kFrisconar says, "Oh the grand and mighty council. Those has-beens don't know the first thing about government. Seems they're switching their opinion on who should rule every day. They should get jobs."
TosApothecary		lake	~kFrisconar says, "There's a temple or something down on an underground lake in the dark caves. I wouldn't bother going if I were you. First off, you need a key. And if you do get in, the chill is just miserable."
TosApothecary		paddock	~kFrisconar says, "What, did Paddock tell you to see me? Seems I have to give that thief a commission every time someone mentions his name in here. And he's brought me nothing but trouble."
TosApothecary		love	~kFrisconar says, "The fair Madelia is my true love. She used to live here in Tos when we were together. Then that miserable Frular told her that her cloth shop would do better near Barloque. And the Princess commissioned her to make her royal gowns. The next thing I know my dear Madelia has moved to the Bourgeois Castle. I'm sure she is bewitched by some cruel Riija cult."
TosApothecary		cult	~kFrisconar says, "The cults have been plotting against me for years. They think I'm not aware of them, but I know they are out there."
BasicInnKeeper		hello	~kRycksher says, "What?... oh. Welcome to the Grand Ballroom of his lordship, Akardius, Duke of Tos, Protectorate of the People, and, er... um, oh yeah, future Sovereign of all Meridian."
BasicInnKeeper		bye	~kRycksher says, "Huh, you're leaving? But you hardly even danced. Or tipped the bartender."
BasicInnKeeper		barloque	~kRycksher says, "Oh, don't get me started on Barloque. We hate those guys. They, uh, they did something or other to us. So we hate them."
BasicInnKeeper		barloque	~kRycksher says, "We here in Tos hate Barloque. I'm not sure why, but we probably have a pretty good reason. Those pompous people up there, all snooty with all their money and riches and gold. They aren't in need of a bartender, are they?"
BasicInnKeeper		Tos	~kRycksher says, "Tos is my home town. I know everybody here. Go ahead, ask me about anyone in town."
BasicInnKeeper		help	~kRycksher says, "I'm Rycksher, the bartender. The Duke appointed me to make sure the Ballroom guests are having a good time. Are you having a good time? Like the Music? Have a gift to be wrapped? Need a drink?"

BasicInnKeeper		princess	~kRycksher says, "A pox on the Princess!"
BasicInnKeeper		princess	~kRycksher says, "She must be sitting smugly in her little castle. A pox on her! A pox on her!"
BasicInnKeeper		council	~kRycksher says, "I'll drink to the Council!"
BasicInnKeeper		council	~kRycksher says, "A pox on the Council!"
BasicInnKeeper		paddock	~kRycksher says, "My brother Paddock owns Familiars. He's the best bartender in the world. In case you haven't guessed, I'm the second best."
BasicInnKeeper		frisconar	~kRycksher says, "Frisconar, he's a strange guy, always whining about something. 'oh, I think I'm getting the Orc plague.', 'oh, why did Madelia have to leave me, I'm so lonely and pitiful. Pity me.' or 'oh, Rycksher, why do you get all the ladies, I'm a little loser, I don't get any of the ladies. The ladies don't like me. Wah-wah.'"
BasicInnKeeper		madelia	~kRycksher says, "Madelia makes clothes. She moved to the Bourgeois Castle to make the big money. I think she had a thing for me."
BasicInnKeeper		skivlat	~kRycksher says, "Skivlat has the perfect job. He just sits around counting money all day. I wish I were him."
BasicInnKeeper		watcher	~kRycksher says, "Cort is the Watcher of the Arena. He was appointed by the Duke around the same time I got this job. We're old school chums. So I'm a little older than he is... so I helped him with his studies. Really."
BasicInnKeeper		cort	~kRycksher says, "Cort is the Watcher of the Arena. He was appointed by the Duke around the same time I got this job. We're old school chums. So I'm a little older than he is... he was just a fast learner."
BasicInnKeeper		fehr'loi	~kRycksher says, "Fehr'loi Qan is an imbecile. We used to make fun of him. But he showed us. Up and moved his shop to Barloque. Making a lot more money now, I hear. I think he was bribed to leave Tos."
BasicInnKeeper		qan	~kRycksher says, "Fehr'loi Qan is an imbecile. We used to make fun of him. But he showed us. Up and moved his shop to Barloque. Making a lot more money now, I hear. I think he was bribed to leave Tos."
BasicInnKeeper		island	~kRycksher says, "What island? My brother Paddock, mentioned there was some newly discovered island."
BasicInnKeeper		drink	~kRycksher says, "I serve imported brew here. If you want the cheap stuff, it's in pitchers in the feast hall next door."
BasicInnKeeper		music	~kRycksher says, "At the Bard's request, the orchestra may play a different song. They know all the tunes in Meridian."
BasicInnKeeper		band	~kRycksher says, "This isn't the only music they play, you know."
BasicInnKeeper		songs	~kRycksher says, "Don'y you like the music?"
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "Did you know this coin was made back during the reign of King Zarcos II?"
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "The original official coin of Meridian had a castle on one side and Prince Far'Nohl on the other. You can't find those around anymore."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "Here's a little known fact for ~Iguh~I-you. The Princess depicted on the back of the shilling was Princess Demetia. If she were still alive, she would be 248, uh no, wait, let me think, 249 years old."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "Shillings, my wonderful friends, your golden sparkle never ends. Huh huh he he."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "Most people say money is dirty. Not me, I ~Iguh~I-wash those shillings every day."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat polishes the same coin over and over.
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "The Vault's getting a little lonely for my friends. Do you want to deposit some shillings, please?"
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "I don't think my ~Iguh~I-vault can hold much more. I might have to rent the room next door for extra storage space."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "What's going on out in the world? Too many people are withdrawing their shillings. That's not fair, they were so comfortable here with their friends."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "I'm so happy. If my bank were, um, a creature that likes to eat a lot, it would be full. I mean because my vault has a lot of ~Iguh~I-money in it right now. Like a troll. They like to eat a lot."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "I bet you didn't know that shillings aren't pure gold. They have copper and iron in them. Only a small part the coin is true gold."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "I'm not sure why those stupid rats scurry of with shillings. I mean I know why I would ~Iguh~I-scurry off with shillings. But they are so little, what do rats need with money."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat says, "I love gems. Not as much as I love shillings. But they are pretty. But not as pretty as shillings."
TosBanker			~kSkivlat counts a stack of shillings. After a few moments, he counts the same stack again."
TosBanker			~kA weird grin crosses Skivlat's face as he shines a few shillings.
TosBanker			~kSkivlat incessantly shakes his pouch of coins. With each metallic clink, his smile broadens. "I love that sound," he says.
TosBanker		hello	~kSkivlat says, "Good %DAYNIGHT, %NAME! What can I ~Iguh~I-do for you?"
TosBanker		hello	~kSkivlat says, "~IGuh~I-hello, %NAME, how are you on this beautiful %DAYNIGHT!"
TosBanker		bye	~kSkivlat says, "Good bye %NAME! Come back again. Say hello to who ever you are going to see for me!"
TosBanker		barloque	~kSkivlat says, "They have lots of shillings up in Barloque. They are all rich up there. I don't like Herbutte though. He's snooty. I sometimes ~Iguh~I-trade gems with him. Oh, but you shouldn't. I can give a better deal here for your gems."
TosBanker		cor NOTH	~kSkivlat says, "I don't know how many shillings are in Cor Noth. Probably more than Jasper."
TosBanker		jasper	~kSkivlat says, "I like Jasper. I would live there because it is so close to the mines, but Yevitan already beat me there."
TosBanker		marion	~kSkivlat says, "The people of Marion don't have many shillings. Those poor people."
TosBanker		tos	~kSkivlat says, "Tos is a ~Iguh~I-great town to live in."
TosBanker		duke	~kSkivlat says, "The Duke lives in the Blackstone Keep on the north end of Tos. He has a lot of Shillings because he can collect taxes. I wish I could collect taxes. I also wish he wouldn't collect taxes from me. But over all, he helps lower the cost of items so I can save more of my money. He's nice."
TosBanker		princess	~kSkivlat says, "The Princess has a lot of money. She's way up near Barloque."
TosBanker		rebels	~kSkivlat spits, Them rebels, shaking up the balance and all, running amuck, and to think, Yevitan is wasting his own money on them."
TosBanker		council	~kSkivlat says, "There is one guy in the council I really admire. His name is Bei-Naq. He has a lot of shillings. More than anyone else in the world."
TosBanker		help	~kSkivlat says, "I can keep your money safe even if you die. I also know a lot about money. I love money, actually."
TosBanker		sell	~kSkivlat says, "I have some gems to sell. I won't sell shillings though, they are too valuable. Oh, and what would you buy them with? It's kind of like a pair a ducks. When you can only buy one duck with another. Huh huh he he."
TosBanker		buy	~kSkivlat says, "I will buy shillings off of you for a gem or two."
TosBanker		guh	~kSkivlat says, "What did you say 'guh' for? You talk funny."
TosBanker		yevitan	~kSkivlat says, "Yevitan runs the Bank in Jasper. My bank has more money in it so he's jealous. I think he cheats his clients too. He doesn't like me. He's like a, uh, like a creature that wouldn't like me very much. Maybe a troll, they probably don't like me.  Not to mention that he is wasteing all his money on those rebels, the fool."
TosBanker		interest	~kSkivlat says, "Interest? Your money will be safe in my bank, they won't have children though."
TosWatcher		hello	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail %NAME!"
TosWatcher		tos	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail Tos, the oldest city in all of Meridian!"
TosWatcher		duke	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail the Memory of Kalior! Hail Duke Akardius!"
TosWatcher		princess	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail Princess Kateriina!"
TosWatcher		cylill	~kThe Watcher says, "General Cylill is a member of the Council and he is my father. He resides on the River Ille."
TosWatcher		qerti'nya	~kThe Watcher says, "You speak of the Priestess Qerti'nya, my mother. She has taught me discipline and courage. You would be wise to visit her out at the Temple of Kraanan beyond the Cragged Mountains."
TosWatcher		kraanan	~kThe Watcher says, "Hail our lord and god, Kraanan of the Fist! Fight in his name, and you will know true strength."
TosWatcher		help	~kThe Watcher says, "I judge all arena matches. Read my banners to learn how to enter."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "All of us on the council seek the magical tokens so that we may crack their secrets and draw from their power. I have my theories on how this magic can be utilized."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "There are many magical portals open that connect areas that do not sit side by side, or even in the same dimension for that matter. Why even the underworld is know to have such portals."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I am indeed a master of all magic, but the balance I must maintain is too precocious for the common wizard. You are better off staying with one school. If your mind becomes clouded with other schools, I suggest you seek the potion of forgetfulness."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Beware of the magic of Riija, for little of it has any substance. Unless you believe it does, of course."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "All magic comes to us directly from the gods. An atheist is impotent here in Meridian. Perhaps worse off though is someone who tries to appease all of the gods at once."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I do not have time to show you how to get to the various temples, if that's what you are here to ask. Hire a mercenary, there are many that can guide the way."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I have theories on how the tokens function in this dimension and how they can be used in the future."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Priestesses are not the only ones who can teach magic to those willing to learn."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Many people wonder if we still have a king. Indeed, it is so. I, and I alone, speak to him frequently. His highness is... too preoccupied with his studies to be burdened by company or the kingdom."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I can not believe how many minor magicians walk with the pride of a full sorcerer. I pity them should they cross my path."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I do not traffic with the other council members very much. They are not to my tastes, except perhaps Esseldi. At least he has the sense to track down the Mana Nodes. He also has some interesting theories on the Tokens."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Do not put any stock in that wasted wizard Maleval. He is a charlatan, nothing more."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Please, warm yourself by my fire."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I sense a peacefulness in the continuum. All is well."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Clearly Shal'ille's magic ranks stronger than that of the other gods."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "How serene the world seems when you fully devote yourself to the goddess Shal'ille."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "The spirit of Shal'ille is with us. A most blessed occurrence."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Do not underestimate the raw power of Faren. I've seen many a lesser sorcerer consumed by his own spells when carelessly cast."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "Kraanan is not just a warrior's god. No, his magic is quite potent in directly combating other spells."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I find Qor's magic to be most potent, don't you? You should master it, her dark shadows are most inviting."
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "It is so easy to follow mistress Qor. A little blood spilled here and there, and then you can drink deeply from her power!"
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I sense the forces of evil strongly now. Yes, that wonderful elation that comes with black magic!"
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I feel the dark spirits of Qor growing restless. Leave my home, else I may release them!"
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar says, "I have some very important mystical research to do. I trust you can find the door!"
OneCouncilor			~kStrangely, the fireplace does not seem to give off as much heat as you would expect. 
OneCouncilor			~kAlzahakar makes a mystical gesture. You are unsure of what magic he may have just cast.
OneCouncilor		hello	~kAlzahakar says, "Greetings, my little friend."
OneCouncilor		bye	~kAlzahakar says, "May the gods see no reason to destroy you."
OneCouncilor		barloque	~kAlzahakar says, "Barloque is an exquisite city. In my days as a fledgling wizard, I maintained residence within her grand walls. It was expensive, but my mastery of magic allowed me with means by which to live there."
OneCouncilor		cor NOTH	~kAlzahakar says, "How many nights did I burn a candle to the base studying at the University in Cor Noth? The scholarly atmosphere was most conducive to higher learning."
OneCouncilor		jasper	~kAlzahakar says, "Jasper, isn't that where Jonas lead his little rebellion too?."
OneCouncilor		marion	~kAlzahakar says, "Marion enjoys the protection of the goddess Shal'ille. It is a very peaceful place to study."
OneCouncilor		tos	~kAlzahakar says, "Tos has no redeeming value. Even the magic shop owner is a disgrace to the world."
OneCouncilor		duke	~kAlzahakar says, "I find that I am torn when placing my vote. Akardius is new, yet quite capable."
OneCouncilor		princess	~k Alzahakar says, "Ah, the fair and clever Princess Kateriina, she will one day make a beautiful queen and powerful sorceress. She is wise to spend her time in support of the magical arts."
OneCouncilor		council	~kAlzahakar says, "The King has personally appointed me, his oldest friend and ally, as the head of the council of five. Together we will break the secrets of the tokens and perhaps use them to mend the ancient Meridian."
OneCouncilor		theory	~kAlzahakar says, "It is my theory that together the tokens could form a powerful bond of magic that would create the Nexus anew. Our problem is we can not seem to get them to stay in one place together long enough to invoke the proper spells and experiments. I could explain further, if you wish."
OneCouncilor		explain	~kAlzahakar says, "The ancient Nexus of power connected this land to the former empire. Long ago, the Nexus snapped and nearly destroyed this world. The five tokens are the magical key to reconstructing the nexus. However, the theoretical new Nexus would not necessarily connect back to the empire of old. Who can truly say what could be in store for us?"
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "It is tragic how often we lose sight of the tokens. Simply put, they are priceless. I indeed have my own theories on why they are so valuable."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "I've heard that there is a new queen spider. I would like to get my hands on her eggs. They have certain... value."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "The safest place for your money is in a bank. Unless you have a hidden gem mine to tuck away your fortune, like I do."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "A buyer can be found for most any item, if you look hard enough."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "I hear legend of a mighty gem created by some long dead alchemist buried away near some underground lake."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Those disgusting Trolls are often attracted to shiny things like gems. I'll wager they have stashed a great deal of treasure over the years."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "A good place to store your treasures is up with the vaultman in Barloque."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "The Justicar in Barloque holds trials of murderers. Bah, we've more of a problem with thieves. The Justicar should hear those cases as well."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Thieves, thieves, everywhere. I cannot stomach such miserable wretches."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Do not stand too close to me. And let me see your hands at all times."
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Who sent you here? What do you want? My gold I'll warrant. Well, you won't be getting it!"
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Well, what do you want?"
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "You look like a thief, come to steal my treasures. Well, you won't get them, I tell you, you won't!"
TwoCouncilor			~kBei Naq says, "Don't even consider robbing me. I can snap my fingers and my personal guards will show you the pointed end of their swords."
TwoCouncilor		hello	~kBei Naq says, "Yes? Why are you here?"
TwoCouncilor		bye	~kBei Naq says, "Be off with you then."
TwoCouncilor		barloque	~kBei Naq says, "Barloque is the richest city in the world and that is why I respect it."
TwoCouncilor		cor nOTH	~kBei Naq says, "Cor Noth has its value. It lies roughly between the Princess and the Duke. The inn is merely acceptable as a place to stay for the night."
TwoCouncilor		jasper	~kBei Naq says, "A pox on Jasper! Much of my fortune was made through Jasper's mines, but now they are all dried up. The town should be closed."
TwoCouncilor		marion	~kBei Naq says, "No one has any money in Marion. Not worth my attention, I tell you."
TwoCouncilor		tos	~kBei Naq says, "Age does not always mean more value. Tos, for example, seems to get less valuable every year."
TwoCouncilor		duke	~kBei Naq says, "My support goes his way on occasion. In fact, generally, I support him. However, the Princess often returns my jeweled token, so I sometimes support her."
TwoCouncilor		princess	~kBei Naq says, "The Princess Kateriina comes from a very rich family. I respect that."
TwoCouncilor		council	~kBei Naq says, "King Zarcos left me, and the other four, in charge of managing the government until his successor is chosen. We have been tasked with studying the priceless tokens."
TwoCouncilor		theories	~kBei Naq says, "Each token is made of the absolute finest of materials, so good in fact that I do not believe they were made by the hands of man. I suspect that they were crafted by gods in a realm beyond Meridian. Each token probably represents a different being of immense power."
TwoCouncilor		value	~kBei Naq says, "The eggs of a giant queen spider are said to have certain value as an aphrodisiac."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "If you really want to know what's what about those beasties out there, you should seek Rook. That chap knows the score."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "The only warrior that's worth his weight has battle scars to brag of. I wouldn't trust a man to defend my castle if he hadn't lived through a really good trouncing or two."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Always remember an army or even a troupe of men is mightier than the single soldier."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Keep an eye out will you for those blasted tokens. I'm in charge of protecting their safety. They are official property of the council, you know."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Did I ever tell you about my underdog strategy in the battle of Ukgoth? The Nasties, or the trolls if you will, had us surrounded. We were thirty men with wounded. They numbered sixty or more. I had my men defend in a cross pattern as our five best flanked their leader. Bloody mess, all in all."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "During my second tour of duty, I found myself and my men faced with ferreting out a small cult of Qor who were randomly picking off our civilians. Those buggers dug them self so deep into the Cragged Mountains with their bloody magic, it took us near five months to give them what for."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Thinking back, it was when our military exercises took us to the Druids Hills when I faced my first troll. Some of the men broke formation. A few of the chaps ran. Not I. I fought side by side with my Sergeant till the bloody beast fell. That's when I knew command was for me."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "I remember when I was promoted to Captain in the Duke's Honor Guard. A small revolution had begun in Jasper. This was back 'round the time of the miner's strike. The whole place was a bloody mess with the scabs returning to the mines and what with all the riots that started up."
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Jolly good day, today was, don't you think!"
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Now if I had moved the orange footmen 'round the river to the north... that might have saved some... but then again we needed a force back for the... What? Ho? Are you still here?"
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "You don't come by way of Tos, do you? How's my son doing there?"
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill says, "Stand up straight."
ThreeCouncilor			~kThe pleasant scent of raspberries hangs in the air near the source of the river.
ThreeCouncilor			~kCylill paces back and forth, muttering something about some long ago war.
ThreeCouncilor		hello	~kCylill says, "Ho chap!"
ThreeCouncilor		bye	~kCylill says, "Cheerio, chap!"
ThreeCouncilor		barloque	~kCylill says, "Barloque is a fairly well defended city. Its walls and moat offer excellent protection to the south, where it needed it in the old Tos wars. But her weakness is in her poorly guarded north shore. A platoon in small boats could shuttle 'round her."
ThreeCouncilor		cor NOTH	~kCylill says, "A rudimentary wall surrounds Cor Noth. She has hardly any military to speak off. And her potential enemies could fully surround her. Very bad design, I say, very bad."
ThreeCouncilor		jasper	~kCylill says, "Jasper has a good natural defense. There are only a few, very visible ways in and out. A small yet well coordinated task force could repel attackers. If war breaks out, that may be the place to go"
ThreeCouncilor		marion	~kCylill says, "Marion has the best defense of all the cities, she's protected by a goddess! I say, what could be better than a goddess who makes your enemies sheath their swords. Ha."
ThreeCouncilor		tos	~kCylill says, "Tos is protected by the capable hands of the Honor Guard. The Badlands offered superb protection to the north during the Barloque wars, but now her enemy comes from the south. It will be interesting to see if they can repel a solid siege."
ThreeCouncilor		duke	~kCylill says, "I hope Akardius can lead troops like Kalior could."
ThreeCouncilor		princess	~kCylill says, "The Princess believes a skilled soldier is better than a strong soldier. Fair logic, I say."
ThreeCouncilor		council	~kCylill says, "Essentially, the council is comprised of myself and four other jolly good chaps. We look after the kingdom in the stead of King Zarcos. Most of the time my peers study these mysterious tokens. I am charged with making sure they don't fall in to the wrong hands."
ThreeCouncilor		qerti'nya	~kCylill says, "Qerti'nya is Cort's mother. She taught me a great deal about our lord Kraanan and about the ways of women. Probably more about the ways of women than I wished to know. She lives way out at the temple beyond the cragged mountains, which is good for her, and bloody good for me."
ThreeCouncilor		mother	~kCylill says, "Qerti'nya is Cort's mother. She taught me a great deal about our lord Kraanan and about the ways of women. Probably more about the ways of women than I wished to know. She lives way out at the temple beyond the cragged mountains, which is good for her, and bloody good for me."
ThreeCouncilor		watcher	~kCylill says, "My son, Cort, is the esteemed Watcher of the Arena. His mother helped him get that position. If it were up to me, he'd be going through a proper and rigid stay in the Duke's army right now."
ThreeCouncilor		cort	~kCylill says, "My son, Cort, is the esteemed Watcher of the Arena. His mother helped him get that position. If it were up to me, he'd be going through a proper and rigid stay in the Duke's army right now."
ThreeCouncilor		son	~kCylill says, "My son, Cort, is the esteemed Watcher of the Arena. His mother helped him get that position. If it were up to me, he'd be going through a proper and rigid stay in the Duke's army right now."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "My fellow councilors are always looking to retrieve the mysterious tokens. We have been tasked with studying them. You'll find each of us have our own theories on how they function."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "The quickest way to recover is to rest at an inn and have yourself a good, warm meal."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "If you want your body to be more resilient, well, you'll have to break it down so that it can heal stronger. Might I say by taking on creatures that are tougher than you."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "A good place to hone your body is in the Arena of Kraanan. You might get some bruises... but you won't face death like combats out in the wild."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "While armor may be good protection, I think it just burdens you down."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "The Tokens are wonderful creatures. Others might call them objects, but I know they have a certain life to them. I have some theories on why that is."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "You'll heal a lot faster if you have a full stomach."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "Now a human has to watch after their own body, but if you want a little help, the ways of Shal'ille can teach you a healing spell."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "I've been out swimming far out in that great big ocean. Those rumors of sea creatures are nonsense. I don't know why they don't sail to deep waters anymore, but I don't believe in sea monsters."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "I've seen over sixty five winters. That's a lot, my friend. You don't see sixty five winters by being careless with your body. Some men and women half my age aren't in nearly as good a shape. Ha, I show them, I do."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "I'm particular to the Demon Skull token because it seems the most negative towards life force. I gather that whatever beast it came from was diametrically opposed to life. Being the healthiest councilor, it's best that I keep track of it."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "This old castle here, it's the oldest structure in the land. I'm surprised it's still standing. Perhaps the spirit of ancient King Far'Nohl keeps it from crumbling to dust."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "breathe in... breathe out... breathe in deeply... breathe out deeply... "
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "My body is my temple. If you don't eat better, your body will be your junkyard."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "What did you have to eat today? The best food is the most natural food."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "If you want to live to see my age, you best eat better and exercise your mind and body often."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "How often do you exercise each day? I'm guessing not enough."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx says, "What matters if you change the town you live in? The only true house that you own is your body and that address you can not change."
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx chants, "Ohm... Ohm... Ohm... say it with me now... Ohm... Ohm... Ohm... "
FourCouncilor			~kDrechx begins to rigorously exercise.
FourCouncilor			~kClosing his eyes and relaxing his body, Drechx enters a deep trance.
FourCouncilor			~kThe horrid smell of decay comes from the ancient castle.
FourCouncilor			~kYou have an uncomfortable feeling as you stand before the ancient castle, as if mankind was not meant to return to these walls.
FourCouncilor			~kInhuman screams can be heard from within the dark castle.
FourCouncilor			~kJust standing before the immense, dark structure, you are overwhelmed with an eerie feeling.
FourCouncilor		hello	~kDrechx says, "Greetings, my friend. How's your health today?"
FourCouncilor		bye	~kDrechx says, "Good health to you, friend."
FourCouncilor		barloque	~kDrechx says, "The capital city of Barloque is afflicted with rats. Those rich fellows there ought to spend some shillings on mercenaries to rid her sewers of the vermin, before disease is spread."
FourCouncilor		cor NOTH	~kDrechx says, "The scholars' town of Cor Noth suffers from a pollution problem. They best clean out their stream before it spawns more dreaded slime on the world."
FourCouncilor		jasper	~kDrechx says, "Since the intrusion of Joans and the rebellion into thier lives I must say that the citizen's health is much improved.  Although I could not reccomend it as a usual treatment."
FourCouncilor		marion	~kDrechx says, "Marion is a town in perfect health. It balances the simple needs of the body with the temperament of peaceful living. It is small, but I guarantee that town will outlive the others."
FourCouncilor		tos	~kDrechx says, "The city of Tos suffers from old age. All things in life must age, whether living or stone, and poor Tos rests on her last legs. Only new life can restore her walls."
FourCouncilor		duke	~kDrechx says, "This Akardius has his head on straight. If the people will it, my vote is his."
FourCouncilor		princess	~kDrechx says, "She has what it takes to rule the land, yet there is a naivete that prevents my full support."
FourCouncilor		council	~kDrechx says, "King Zarcos was wise to abdicate the throne to us five councilors. His mind is afflicted with mental health problems that have been seen in a few of the Kings before him. He needed to remove himself from the pressures of rule in order to heal. The five of us will see to the Kingdom, until a successor is chosen."
FourCouncilor		token	~kDrechx says, "The tokens have a warm life affirming glow coming from them. A soul, I'd say. That's why monsters scurry to gather them. It's the nature of life to attract other life. That's also why death doesn't seem to have such dire effects on us humans when we carry a token. It shares part of its life force with us. Alzahakar has some theories of his own on this."
FourCouncilor		ohm	~kDrechx says, "Good, don't you feel more relaxed now?"
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "I've been studying these tokens for a long time now. I think I'm starting to figure out why they keeping popping around on us. Just some theories really, but I'm making progress."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "If you're a clever explorer, you'll figure out the way to the inside of the stone circle in the land of Trolls."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "I tell you I have been almost everywhere it seems, except the underworld that is. Strange how there are so many ways to get out of the afterlife. A lot of open doors... "
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "I find that traveling around is the best way to learn about the world, but there are some people that can teach you a thing or two as well."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "All of the Gods have temples out here in the wilds. Problem is finding them. I still don't have a clue to where old Riija has hidden out. And I'm beginning to believe that whatever was left of Jala's temple is long gone, washed away by the servants of Qor."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "If you are hunting for the Mana Nodes, it's an awfully good idea to hire a mercenary to guide you. The paths are often treacherous. I'd guide you myself, but I'm off on my own quest now."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "I'm heading up towards the Seafarer's Peak myself. It's a wonderful view up there."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "The one place I hate exploring is those blasted sewers. They seem to go on forever. It would be interesting, but they just smell so bad."
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "Smell that fresh air!"
FiveCouncilor			~kEsseldi says, "There's nothing like a good hike to clear your mind. As long as your careful about the animals that is."

FiveCouncilor		barloque	~kEsseldi says, "Ah, old Barloque! It's been a few years since I've seen her. Truth to tell, I find her a bit stuffy. Only stop there to collect some gear on the way to visit the princess."
FourCouncilor		cor NOTH	~kEsseldi says, "You like standing around in towns, Cor Noth's one of the nicer ones. They ask me to give lectures at the University from time to time. One day, I'll get around to it, I figure."
FiveCouncilor		jasper	~kEsseldi says, "There's some great people in Jasper, let me tell you. Hard working town with good, hard working people."
FiveCouncilor		marion	~kEsseldi says, "Marion's such a nice little town. Friendly people. Good farmers. There's nothing better than a good hot meal in Marion after being out in the wilds for a few weeks."
FiveCouncilor		tos	~kEsseldi says, "I don't much care for Tos as a town. Don't get me wrong, the architecture is amazing, like a piece of history sitting right there. But the people don't much respect the antiquity of the city and tend to abuse it. I only go through Tos when I need to advise the Duke."
FiveCouncilor		council	~kEsseldi says, "Myself and four other gentlemen were chosen by King Zarcos V to guide the country while he was off doing his own exploring. I don't think he's coming back to the throne personally, so it's going to be ultimately up to us councilors to choose his successor. Personally, I could do with out all the politics."
FiveCouncilor		drechx	~kEsseldi says, "Drechx can usually be found out near old Castle Victoria. It's quite a hike from here. It's amazing how good a shape that old man is in."
FiveCouncilor		theories	~kEsseldi says, "It's a little complicated to explain, but I think the tokens move around on their own because of the way they interact with the mana fields. Each act like magnets, pulling these items around in different directions. There's more to it than that. I won't bore you with the explanation."
FiveCouncilor		explain	~kEsseldi says, "I believe that the fabric of magic pulls the Tokens towards itself. In our world we have several mana nodes of power and dozens of wizards activating magic at different times and power levels. When the Tokens are pulled from enough angles, they pop towards, but not necessarily to, the strongest ones. I don't know why the monsters grab them up though, I think Drechx is working on that one."

MarionBartender			~kTova has a mug, and takes a sip occasionally. 
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Aye, the hotel rooms in Barloque may look small, but it's only because the rats are so big. It must be the rich diet, don't you think, Morrigan?"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "So this adventurer walks into the tavern, he wants to know where he can find a troll. I says, well, depends on where you left him! Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "No, but in fairness now, if you want to improve your skills at combat, you'd do best to pick a fight that you'll have ~I some ~I trouble finishing."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "When you're feeling a little worn out, you can be sure you'll be welcome at The Limping Toad, %SIRMADAM. I think you'll find an inn or a tavern is the place to rest up."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "If you're new to the business of fighting monsters, then you'd best stick to battling those beasties that are within your abilities. Aye, many young adventure types hunt the rats, and the baby spiders."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Marion may be a slow kind of place, but we remember what's important and keep our houses in order. It always pays to be respectful to those you meet, and you will learn important lessons that will help to guide you."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "I've heard that the temples serving the four gods are remote, but that they are accessible to the devoted. In truth the temple of Shal'ille is close to this town, and many a pilgrim stops in my little tavern for a little... fortification... on their way to see the priestess."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Gather up interesting things along the trail, you can never tell what may draw a shilling or two in town, %SIRMADAM. Morrigan there may even be interested, for he peddles all sorts of nonsense back there in his nook. Isn't that right, Morrigan?"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Did you folks see Ran er'Hoth on the way into town? Crazy as a march hare, that man, aye but that's a different story now. Many of the people passing through Marion stop in on him, ha, ha, and seek his wisdom!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "If it's the fighting you're curious about now, why then go see Rook up in Cor Noth. He was a great officer in the King's Army, %SIRMADAM, and a hero to many of us. He makes his living now by training those that live and die by the sword."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Watch for the living trees in these parts, for they are a wonder indeed. But do not harm them... it is bad luck and misfortune upon those that do."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Watch your step in the mountains. The paths up there are treacherous, and overrun with every kind of evil beast %SIRMADAM."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Lady Aftyn now, is a newcomer to this town. She is a real Lady, and I won't tolerate any bad talk of her in here. She helps those that are in need... the sick, wretched, the injured, and the impoverished."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Colhorr, now, in fairness... he's a competent blacksmith, %SIRMADAM, and may have a few items that would draw your eye. Aye, but he's deaf as a post from hitting that anvil longer than you and I have been in breeches, so speak clearly when you talk to him."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Nodes? I don't node nothing about nodes. How about you, Morrigan? Do you node about nodes? Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "This is a great life in Marion, %SIRMADAM, I learn more than you might suspect from serving the locals and the passers through. Aye, and sometimes enjoy a pint or two myself."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "I spent some time in Tos, and I'll tell you now, it's a place that hides from its own evil intentions. Ignorant, lazy people. Why, even the dead are restless, and rise from the ground to haunt the graveyard! Aye, it's true!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Paddock is the type of guy who started out in life at the bottom... and then sank."
MarionBartender			~kTova recites, "Fams is the tavern in TosWhere the paths of all Meridian crossbut when you go there you'll wonderjust who made the blunderand made the village idiot the boss!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Ah, there's nothing wrong with Paddock that reincarnation won't fix."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "That Paddock never did a thing in his life, and even that he hasn't done well."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "A fella I know told Paddock he should just try to be himself. Isn't that terrible advice? Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Ah sure, everybody loves Paddock, and so does he."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "I heard Paddock was trying to hire a dwarf to help him behind the bar... he thinks it will make the drinks look bigger!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Did you hear about the man from Marion, an honest farmer now, who was stabbed thirty-five times in his own home? Aye, he was only learning to eat with a fork!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "You know the recipe for making chicken soup in Jasper? Well now first thing, you steal two chickens... "
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "On the other hand, you have different fingers. Ha, ha, ha, ha!! Different fingers!! Get it Morrigan? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "%SIRMADAM, did you know the people of Marion invented the wheelbarrow? Aye, well, then they gave the design to the good folk of Jasper, to teach them to walk upright... "
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "A farmer from Marion is lying in bed next to his wife. He tells her 'Dear wife, I've got terrible insomnia'. 'Well,' she says 'If you go to sleep, it won't bother you.' Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "I knew this fella from Jasper who never had a shilling to his name... so he changed his name!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Aye, I know another fella from Tos, who is so lazy he can sleep twenty-four hours a day. The only trouble is, he sleeps thirty hours a day."
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "And this woman I know from Tos, known her all my life, I swear to the blessed saints. She is ~Iso~I lazy she could become a landmark! By the gods, there's nothing else of interest to see in that wretched place! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "%SIRMADAM, I heard about a fella from Tos who was so lazy, that he died at twenty-five and no one figured it out until he was fifty!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "I've got this brother-in-law, can't keep a shilling to his name. He borrows so much money from me, at night my wife goes through HIS pockets!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "%SIRMADAM, did you hear about the Lady in Barloque, men always wanted her hand in marriage. The problem is that they had to take the rest of her too! Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "I know a old man here in Marion, a bit simple like many of the others in these parts. But you've got to give him this... he'll never be too old to learn a few new ways to be stupid!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "This fella passed through the tavern a while back, and Morrigan told me afterward that he was an outlaw. Said he's a wanted man in Barloque. So I asked Morrigan, now why do you think they would want any more thieves in Barloque? Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Before we were married, my wife would always complain, 'You're only after one thing.' Aye, now I've forgotten what it was. Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Two Ladies from Barloque are talking. One Lady says 'How do you keep your youth?' The other Lady says, 'Well, I lock him in the closet!' Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "I got one for you. What's the difference between a woman from Cor Noth and an Orc? About forty pounds and a scimitar!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "A man hereabouts went to the healer, only to find out he had but six months left to live. The healer now, she suggested that he sell his house in Marion, and move to Cor Noth. So the man says 'Will that help me live longer?' 'No,' the healer says, 'but it will certainly seem longer!'"
MarionBartender			~kTova winks at Morrigan good-naturedly.
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "I hear the Princess said that civilization in Barloque will last ten thousand years. She forgot to tell us when it's going to begin. Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "So this farmer walks into the tavern here, and asks me what time it is. I tell him it's four-fifteen. He narrows his eyes looking at me and says 'I must be going crazy, Tova. All day long I've been getting different answers!' Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
MarionBartender			~kTova says, "Keep the noise down over there, or you'll find yourselves on the street!"
MarionBartender			~kTova grumbles, and busies himself cleaning glasses.
MarionBartender		Hello	~kTova shouts, "Come in, my friend. What took you so long to get here?"
MarionBartender		Hello	~kTova says, "And a good day to you, %SIRMADAM! Can I get you something to drink, or perhaps a bite of food?"
MarionBartender		Hello	~kTova says, "Good day there. What will you have, %SIRMADAM?"
MarionBartender		Hello	~kTova says, "Ah, hello there %SIRMADAM."
MarionBartender		Hello	~kTova says, "And who are you? Get out, we don't have what you need."
MarionBartender		Hello	~kTova says, "Ah, good evening %SIRMADAM. Look who's here, Morrigan!"
MarionBartender		Hello	~kTova says, "Aye, come in, come in, let's get you something to warm up your bones now."
MarionBartender		Hello	~kTova says, "It's a fine evening %SIRMADAM, sure it is."
MarionBartender		Hello	~kTova sneers, "What are they flushing out of the sewers of Barloque now, Morrigan? Look what the cat dragged in."
MarionBartender		bye	~kTova says, "May you fare well, %SIRMADAM."
MarionBartender		bye	~kTova says, "Don't bother coming back."
MarionBartender		barloque	~kTova says, "Barloque is in the north, and claims itself the Royal City of Meridian. But I try not to knock the rich. I never got a job from a poor person, don't you know!"
MarionBartender		cor NOTH	~kTova says, "Cor Noth now, is just a step behind the rest of us. You see, they've got their heads in the clouds and their feet are not on the ground. Aye, but it's a fine place, and do they love to talk %SIRMADAM! Did you hear the one about how years ago, Tos and Barloque went to war? Well, Tos and Barloque had some silly dispute, and their pride to boot, and neither city would move an inch to meet the other. Finally, without any hope of negotiations they figured the only resort was to start a war between themselves. The next day, Cor Noth surrendered! Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
MarionBartender		jasper	~kTova says, "Oh, yes, it's to the south of here and up high in the mountains. The people up there are their own sort, fierce and independent %SIRMADAM. Not the type you want to pick a fight with."
MarionBartender		marion	~kTova says, "Marion? Well, you're looking at it my friend, unless you need a shovel mended or the counsel of an ancient madman."
MarionBartender		barloque	~kTova says without looking at you, "What, are you still here?"
MarionBartender		tos	~kTova says, "By the Holy Martyrs, it's a miserable place. Aye, take my advice on this, %SIRMADAM. I spent a fair piece of my youth there, and I'll never go back. The people of Tos are so lazy, they can't even exercise their discretion!"
MarionBartender		tos	~kTova says, "Tos is a town with little cheer, and let me warn you about the public house there, %SIRMADAM. The innkeeper Paddock is a muddy-headed liar, as likely to swindle you down as offer you a beer. He's the type of man who never exaggerates his accomplishments, but he tries his best. You know, the type of man that would belittle his inferiors, if he could find any. Ha, ha, ha, ha!!!"
MarionBartender		tos	~kTova says, "A pox on that town. Why don't you take your business elsewhere, stranger, because you're not welcome here."
MarionBartender		duke	~kTova says, "I hear Akardius has taken well to his uncle's duties. How convenient."
MarionBartender		duke	~kTova says, "I guess he got his... "
MarionBartender		kalior	~kTova says, "Hush now Morrigan, you know better than that. It's best not to speak so with all these people here."
MarionBartender		wryn's	~kTova says, "You ask the people in Jasper how they feel about The Wryn's Keep, that thief Frular of Barloque renting it out like a common grange hall... why that's their ancestral capitol, and in the heart of everyone from Jasper!"
MarionBartender		wryn's	~kTova says, "Aye, it's an old fortress outside of Jasper, and the traditional capital of the mountain kingdom of old. It is said that a half-hundred good fighters could hold the Cragged Mountains against an army if they hold The Wryn's Keep."
MarionBartender		zig	~kTova hisses, "Those black-hearted thugs, sneaking around and spying on innocent folk... they should be hunted down like wild dogs and put on the gallows with their black-hearted master, the Duke."
MarionBartender		zig	~kTova amiably says, "Now I don't know what you might be talking about there."
MarionBartender		zig	~kTova says, "Some things are better left unsaid, and I'll tell you this on your way out of me bar, that black name is one of them."
MarionBartender		council	~kTova says, "Yes, well the council... you will hear a lot of talk about the council, but not in Marion. We stay out of the politics and intrigue here, %SIRMADAM."
MarionBartender		treefolk	~kTova says, "Yes, there are treefolk in these parts, a kind and legendary creature that keep very much among themselves. The elders of Marion speak of their wisdom and intelligence, but they keep entirely to themselves now. It is said that something terrible happened to them in the past, isolating them to this day."
MarionBartender		fey	~kTova says, "Aye, the wee things are a sight to see all right! Myself and Morrigan went up north there to get a look for ourselves, didn't we Morrigan? Unpredictable though, I'm not ashamed to say we turned and ran when the little buggers turned nasty on us! You should have seen us coming out of those woods!"
MarionBartender		shal'ille	~kTova says, "You'd be better asking the Good Lady Aftyn about Shal'ille. She is versed in the ways, and such a kind soul."
MarionBartender		revolution	~kTova says, "All in good time, my friend. When the king calls upon us, Marion will answer in kind."
MarionBartender		blessed	~kTova says, "I have heard that ~I his Majesty the King ~I is ~I in the sanctuary, ~I under the care of ~I Lady Aftyn ~I!! They say that soon he will be fit again to rule, %SIRMADAM!! Oh, blessed saints, oh glorious day!!"
MarionBartender		whiskey	~kTova says, "Troll Whiskey? You have some? Hey Morrigan, get the good glasses down from the shelf and dust them off!"
MarionBartender		lady aftyn	~kTova says, "They say that she is of nobility, from Barloque, and that her husband left her a fortune after he passed on %SIRMADAM. Aye, they also say that the fortune is right here in Marion with her, at the asylum."
MarionBartender		lady aftyn	~kTova says, "She is a saint. An absolute saint. Bless her heart."
MarionBartender		kraanan	~kTova says, "No offense intended, but my religion is right here in my mug, %SIRMADAM. How about I pour you a pint of salvation?"
MarionBartender		sell	~kTova says, "This is a tavern, my friend. It's not too complicated."
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan says, "Ha ha, oh Tova, you kill me!"
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan says, "Ha haha, hahahahah, hahahahah, ha ha ha!!"
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan says, "Ha ha ha ha, hahaha, ha hee hee!!"
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan laughs out loud!
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan says, "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!!"
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan says, "Hee, hee, Tova, hee hee heeheehee!!!"
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan says, "Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha!"
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan says, "Tee hee, tee heeheehee, tee hee!!"
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan bursts into hysterical laughter, which subsides in a bout of coughing.
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan holds his sides, and tears of laughter roll down his cheeks.
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan is gasping for air, just laughing and laughing.
MarionInnKeeper			~kMorrigan laughs uncontrollably.
MarionInnKeeper			~k~ISomewhere outside the bar, a rooster crows.~I
MarionInnKeeper		hello	~kMorrigan says, "Hello, welcome back!"
MarionInnKeeper		hello	~kMorrigan says, "Hello!"
MarionInnKeeper		Hello	~kMorrigan says, "Good day!"
MarionInnKeeper		Hello	~kMorrigan looks down glumly.
MarionInnKeeper		Hello	~kMorrigan says, "Er, hello!"
MarionInnKeeper		Hello	~kMorrigan says, "Come on in!"
MarionInnKeeper		Hello	~kMorrigan says, "Good Evening!"
MarionInnKeeper		Hello	~kMorrigan busies himself with some thing under the counter.
MarionInnKeeper		bye	~kMorrigan says, " So long!"
MarionInnKeeper		bye	~kMorrigan clears his throat.
MarionInnKeeper		kalior	~kMorrigan says, " The rabid cur has finally been put to sleep."
MarionInnKeeper		kalior	~kMorrigan says, "His fate has been decided by a higher power. He shall harass Meridian no longer."
MarionInnKeeper		duke	~kMorrigan scowls.
MarionInnKeeper		princess	~kMorrigan sneers, " That traitorous Kalior! Even in death he attacks the throne. This time with that impudent whelp of a nephew! "
MarionInnKeeper		morrigan	~kMorrigan says, " Yes, Tova."
MarionInnKeeper		 morrigan	~kMorrigan says, " True, Tova, true."
MarionInnKeeper		morrigan	~kMorrigan says, " Aye, Tova!!"
MarionInnKeeper		mushroom	~kMorrigan says, " Mushrooms? I buy mushrooms!"
MarionInnKeeper		king	~kMorrigan says, " The King is my liege, and I await the chance to serve his will."
MarionInnKeeper		pants	~kMorrigan says, " We have pants for sale, right over here! Good Marion canvas, too, the best that money can buy!"
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "You probably noticed that ramshackle hut across the way, near the stables. Well, it does stick out, seeing as the rest of the town is tidy, and proud. Aye, that's the hut of Ran er'Hoth, %SIRMADAM. I could tell you stories... "
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "You look like you appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into a well made weapon, and I'll tell you what, so do I. Yes I do. I have quite a collection too, but I keep that somewhere safe."
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "If you've got old weapons you're looking to get rid of, might be I'm interested. Sure, can't keep too much scrap iron around."
MarionBlacksmith		sell	~kColhorr says, "I might have a thing or two here you'd be interested in looking at."
MarionBlacksmith		teach	~kColhorr says, "Teach? Well, now... I know a few things, that's the truth. I know a bit about the old ways, for my people came out of the Cragged Mountains in my great-grandfathers time and brought the ways of Kraanan with them. They made their weapons from the ethers, just like that. Aye, there's some there I could show you too, but you need some understanding of his ways to use his magics."
MarionBlacksmith		help	~kColhorr says, "What do you need help with? This is a simple place, not too difficult to figure out, so I can't see where you'd need help with that. Aye, there's plenty I could teach you, you bet, but you certainly don't need my help to get around Marion."
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "Did you try our local tavern? That Tova now, he is a kick in the pants. Aye, a real hoot %SIRMADAM."
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "These are quiet parts. Good people, hard working people, er, with one exception."
MarionBlacksmith		ran er'hoth	~kColhorr says, "Ran er'Hoth? He... well, I suppose that you're going to hear this elsewhere, so I might as well put it kindly. He is a little touched. Aye, he is."
MarionBlacksmith		ran er'hoth	~kColhorr shouts, "Ran er'Hoth? Well now, it isn't kind to speak ill of the cretins and half-wits of the world, so I'll just hold my tongue."
MarionBlacksmith		ran er'hoth	~kColhorr screams, "That man is an idiot, and you don't have to be sauced on Troll Whiskey to see that. He has spent the last ten years ridiculing the people of Marion, and now has the nerve to return and expect charity from us. Well, he gets nothing from me. Nothing. Now be on your way."
MarionBlacksmith			~k~IThe heat in this shop is almost unbearable.~I
MarionBlacksmith			~k~IThe blacksmith's shop is swelteringly hot.~I
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr screams, "Did you say something about knitting needles?"
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "Huh?"
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "Oh, did you say something?"
MarionBlacksmith			~k~IColhorr is sweating profusely~I
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "What's this?"
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr shouts, "Yes, well speak up please."
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr glares at you. 
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr scratches absently.
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "What have you got there?"
MarionBlacksmith		hello	~kColhorr says, "Yes? Oh, hello there, hello... "
MarionBlacksmith		hello	~kColhorr says, "Yes?"
MarionBlacksmith		hello	~kColhorr says, "Huh? I thought I told you you're not welcome here."
MarionBlacksmith		bye	~kColhorr says, "Yes, well, good bye now."
MarionBlacksmith		bye	~kColhorr mumbles something to himself.
MarionBlacksmith		barloque	~kColhorr says, "Broke? What's broke? Let's have a look, maybe I can fix it."
MarionBlacksmith		broke	~kColhorr says, "Ah, well... it's a fair city, grand actually. Aye it's a grand city, certainly grand, grand grand grand capital of Meridian."
MarionBlacksmith		cor NOTH	~kColhorr says, "What? East Tos? East Tos, uh... aye, well, Tos is east of here, through Ileria, that's a valley. To the east. Just east, actually. But aye, it's east. East. And the bank's there, sure."
MarionBlacksmith		jasper	~kColhorr says, "Jasper? No, no you must be lost, %SIRMADAM. You're in MARION... that's right, MARION, M-A-R-I-O-N."
MarionBlacksmith		marion	~kColhorr says, "Aye, indeed this is Marion. That's exactly where you are. What can I do for you %SIRMADAM?"
MarionBlacksmith		tos	~kColhorr says, "Oh, Tos. Aye, well in Tos there is an arena where the warriors fight with great weapons. Great weapons, iron and steel, whatnot."
MarionBlacksmith		duke	~kColhorr says, "In Marion? No, no, there's no Duke in Marion. But there is a Lady, and what a kind soul she is, indeed. A real Lady. She lives to help the unfortunate, Marion's own saint."
MarionBlacksmith		princess	~kColhorr says, "Shirtless? Well, I know it's not proper, but I put on my shirt whenever I go out of my shop! It's the heat from my forge, you see... well, you will notice it's quite hot in here. Hot. Yes, quite hot indeed."
MarionBlacksmith		hot	~kColhorr says, "Of course it's hot! You think I don't know it's hot in here? I KNOW it's hot in here. You don't need to tell me it's hot in here, after thirty-five years at this forge, I know exactly how hot it is in here. Humpf. Hot."
MarionBlacksmith		council	~kColhorr says, "Council? Uh, that doesn't ring any bells."
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "The shop is closed, all done for the day. Go on your way now."
MarionBlacksmith		whiskey	~kColhorr says, "Aye, nasty stuff."
MarionBlacksmith		sell	~kColhorr says, "Well, let's see... I make a couple of different weapons, and those are for sale. Otherwise, I am busy fixing things up for the farmers around Marion."
MarionBlacksmith		orc	~kColhorr says, "Goodness, you're better off staying away from the orcs altogether. Foul creatures, sworn enemies of all people. Why I remember a day when armies were raised to hunt them down and smash them completely. Aye, I've seen some of the weapons that those orcs make. Oh boy. Impressive. Scimitars with a blade as long as your arm."
MarionBlacksmith		centipede	~kColhorr says, "Centipede? Well, I know that they look awful, but in fairness now they are quite harmless if you let them be."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "It is the corruption of age, dear child, nothing more, or less. But still there are things even a lunatic old man can teach you. I have lived my life off the land, a being of peace."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "I saw the night, and there is a great many motions in the sky. You are a fool to be here at all. Go out there now. So I am lost."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "We have no meaningful contact with our great grandmother, who is in the sea. And she is broken-hearted, because where are her children and where are her grandchildren? There are six gods, not four, and her children fight as though given the run of the place, as if we were the rough men. So you look at me like the truth is elusive, but you will see. There is but One Temple, and we are all here, now, child. Now."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "See the corruption of Barloque bubble and froth, boiling and boiling and boiling dry. See the rats come as messengers over the land. The vermin turn out to expose the rotten core, and our ridiculous conceptions of nobility. NOBILITY. We so feverishly thrust it upon others but cannot find within ourselves. Is that something that you would like to explain to a child, or a foreigner? Am I getting through to you?"
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "Listen. There are others, elders as I am, who yet live and carry in their hearts pieces of the fractured past. Remember their names. Drechx, who seeks. Alzahakar, the Royal Toady, now mad from his magics. The Vulture Bei Naq. And D'xor, remember that name, Afiera D'xor. Where the others have accepted positions of state, D'xor devotes himself to clarity, and to the pursuit of tenable solutions and to philosophy. Find him, speak with him, child. If he will talk to you, listen."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth screams, "Aaaaarrrrrgh!! Waterlogged!! Get you gone!!!!!!"
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "The poison of the demented forests does exist, an abomination of nature!! Traveling among the twisted beasts there is a toxin lethal to man, which burns through your blood and weakens your will."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "WHAT SKELETONS!?! Skeletons now!?! SKELETONS IN MARION!!??!!"
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "What do you seek in the broken ravings of a madman, child?"
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "In my dream there is a room at the end of a long hallway, and the room is considerable, gross, surrounded by bars like a cage is. Like a cage that the people in Cor Noth use to keep songbirds, and there are stones with men's faces, and a little girl who surrounds herself with lies."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "In another dream the mountains open for the lost orphan, there are people making roads out of music. Then the sky turns dark as a bruise, and instead of being destroyed, cities rise from war. Two cities, each the opposite of another but sharing a common gate. When the sky clears it is white instead of black and blue, but the cities are gone."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "Hmmmm... "
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "I AM STILL LOOKING!!! CAN'T YOU SEE I'M STILL LOOKING!?!"
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "Blank. Blank blank blank blank blank."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "And so it goes, and so it goes. On and on, into infantile absurdity."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "My mind is torn, maybe like a broken web. Strand here, strand there. These days, they fall over themselves and lay piled up around the corners of this shack. Flotsam, debris, unkind things. Look around yourself, child. See what you'll find?"
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "Sing, sung. Rang, rung. Alarm! Alarm!"
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "I have another dream where a magician makes everyone blind. We cannot see, but must feel our way around, families are separated, bonds shattered, and everywhere we find each other to be strangers. What once was our lives, everything is unfamiliar. We spend all of our time hiding beneath the roots of a gigantic tree."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "Come closer. Let me look at you."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "Another dream, now. The sea begins to cough, and shakes the land into six pieces, and when the water leaves, the people follow it back and I am alone amongst the islands. There is a great walled fortress, and from the top I can see a vast wilderness that stretches away in every direction. My father appears, and we follow the rest of the people into the sea."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "I am The Goblin King."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "Rotten apples. Rotten, wormy apples, full of holes... "
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "What do you have there, child?"
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "Your head's too small. Freak of nature."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "You want my wisdom? Ignore the clocks, all of them. You are only playing at their game."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "DON'T RIP ME OFF. Do you understand that? Do you? DON'T RIP ME OFF."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "I can change."
MarionElder			~k~ISomething flutters in the darkness of the hut. A bird, perhaps, a piece of parchment.~I
MarionElder			~k~IThis hut smells like somebody built a bonfire out of cinnamon and dirty socks.~I
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth appears to be dozing.
MarionElder			~k~IYou hear a scritch-scratch sound on the roof, like little feet.~I
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth seems lost in thought.
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth glares at you.
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth giggles.
MarionElder		hello	~kRan er'Hoth says, "What's this?"
MarionElder		bye	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Yes... "
MarionElder		barloque	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Barloque is a corrupted volcano of filth disguised as a ghost town. Go there, child. You will see what I mean, exactly. They turn their poor out of the city, and lavish in opulence."
MarionElder		cor NOTH	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Cor Noth is a very young town, just east of Marion. I remember when all that there was of the town was a waystation, but it has grown and built up a respectable university for itself. There is something else about that town... "
MarionElder		jasper	~kRan er'Hoth says, "To the south, and tucked away in the mountains. The Jasper people are stones of the mountains, and each is but a part of the mountain itself, misleading little stones and rocks that carry the secrets of that hard place. They are a spirited, free people, once completely independent, and with their own language. But you'll never hear that spoken now."
MarionElder		marion	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The people here are passive, kind, and unquestioning, but don't mistake that for a lack of perception. These are my people, and I am among them, but they have chosen the way of the seasons, and will endure."
MarionElder		tos	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Tos is an ancient city and by all rights should know better, but the city's pride and avarice has gotten the best of its people. They live behind locked doors, the people of Tos."
MarionElder		duke	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The Duke is dead. Why is there another Duke?"
MarionElder		duke	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Duke. A nobleman with the highest hereditary rank, a prince who rules an independent duchy. Duchy. The territory ruled by a duke or duchess; dukedom."
MarionElder		duke	~kRan er'Hoth says, "There is a rhyme going around...Because of a poisoned dagger, there was one who did stagger... Then...There lies the Duke, all bloody in his puke!"
MarionElder		princess	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Prestidigitation. Do you know what that means? It means sleight-of-hand. That's as far as the princess gets, believe me, with this business about ~Imagic~I and supporting ~Imagic~I. She supports magic with about the same veracity and comprehension as a stone pedestal supporting the Book of Knowledge. She is a dabbler, and will not survive; for the schools of magic demand a serious toll, not the fawning preoccupation of a sophomoric lightweight. Beware the magics, child. They will corrupt to their own ends, and eventually destroy."
MarionElder		princess	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Princess. A female member of the royal family; the consort of a prince. Family. A group of persons related by blood or marriage; a group of things with common characteristics. Blood. Kinship; temperament; life; lifeblood; bloodshed; murder."
MarionElder		princess	~kRan er'Hoth says, "She is a witch, so we must not speak her name any more, or she will be able to find a window into our souls. Shhh, child."
MarionElder		council	~kRan er'Hoth says, "There is a Council of Five, last appointed by the father of the Princess, King Zarcos V, before he abdicated the throne and lost his marbles. Or did I get that in the wrong order? In any case, they are five elders from throughout the land, smart and powerful people within their limitations, but as a governing body they are toothless and lame, without any sort of executive apparatus at all. I know them. They are an advisory board without a King to advise, careful not to make any sudden moves for fear of drawing attention from any of a number of political factions that could shut them down overnight. So they bide their time and nod along, waiting for nothing. The Council is hobbled, and should absolve."
MarionElder		council	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Council. An assembly called together for consultation, deliberation, etc.; An administrative, legislative, or advisory body. See, who says my memory isn't what it used to be?"
MarionElder		council	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Council? Weeds grow between the council and what they speak, child, old men with rotten teeth and closed minds, each in their own self-imposed exile. They are philosophically bankrupt, for you cannot rule a people from where you've gone into hiding."
MarionElder		alzahakar	~kRan er'Hoth says, "A very intelligent and hard working but nave sorcerer who foolishly believed that he could harness the power of the magics. He has spent his life vying for mastery and understanding of a range of disciplines, Shal'ille, Kraanan, Qor, I believe, and Faren. Impressive, but misguided, for the power of these various forces have twisted his mind so that he is paranoid and delusive."
MarionElder		bei naq	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Bei Naq was once a brilliant scholar, a very learned man. He learned everything so quickly, and such a memory... I remember meeting him as a young man, and the power of his intellect was awesome, his eyes burned through you; penetrating, understanding. But his appetite turned to acquiring wealth and material possessions, which has only gotten stronger in him with his advancing age. Now he is obsessed with what he has gathered, which has driven him away from contact with others, made him suspicious and small."
MarionElder		drechx	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Drechx is a brilliant physician, perhaps the greatest this land has ever known. However, he reached some unknowable point and he quit treating patients with his vast gift of healing altogether. In more recent years he seems to be entirely self centered, spends his time alone and in deep meditation. I suspect that with his understanding of the body and its energies he has completely halted his own aging process, perhaps even reversed it. Politically he is the wisest of the Council, and believes that the people must govern themselves and reject the false motivations of royalty, military, and factional leadership. But he lets his voice become lost to the others on the Council."
MarionElder		afiera d'xor	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Seek him out. Go to the mountains and find him."
MarionElder		whiskey	~kRan er'Hoth hisses, "~IGive it to me, fool.~I"
MarionElder		baby spider	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Baby spiders are a nuisance, and a potentially deadly one so you must stay aware while in the forest. They shouldn't give you too many problems, though, as even the most inexperienced adventurers can deal with a baby spider. The biggest threat they pose is that sooner or later they grow up to become full grown spiders."
MarionElder		spider	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Spiders are a deadly adversary, and even those with years of experience in the wilderness of Meridian approach them with caution, for spiders have a deadly bite that can often be poisonous."
MarionElder		queen spider	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The Queen Spider is the nastiest of the lot, and is matriarch for all of the spiders that plague this land. From the middle of her well protected nest she continues to hatch these toxic and vile creatures. But she is extremely powerful, and has taken on many a well-equipped and courageous party. If you can find her, you will be doing all of the land a favor by extinguishing the Queen Spider, chopping her to bits."
MarionElder		shal'ille	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Shal'ille is the path of light and righteousness, and will balance out the darker forces of our nature if we consider Shal'ille daily while we build our lives. It is also the religion of hypocrisy, for it has many false practitioners that hold themselves and others to the impossible standards of its pious teachings as rules of governance, which cannot be achieved. Religious law is meant to function as a series of guidelines for a better life, and not as the law with which we limit our civilization and judge the world around."
MarionElder		faren	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Ask D'xor about Faren, for he has an understanding about these ways."
MarionElder		faren	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The religion of the natural order, and the most unknowable. For this reason it is very dangerous to dabble in her magics, for you will never see clearly what powers you are tapping into to draw your spells, or where the power of those magics might disperse."
MarionElder		kraanan	~kRan er'Hoth says, "There are six schools, six orders to this world and to all worlds. All six are necessary to keep the flow of power in balance, and our world is now as a man who is fighting the water as he drowns because this balance is lost. Kraanan is guilty of perpetuating the division... and I'll say no more on this now."
MarionElder		kraanan	~kRan er'Hoth says, "In my dream I have seen Kraanan, but he is not a god but a simple craftsman, mending boots and making mediocre garments of rough wool. In my dream the items that he produces are shoddy, and people buy them because they are nostalgic and pitiful of an old veteran who lives on the charitable actions of others. In my dream he has only one arm, and only one leg."
MarionElder		riija	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Here is a fact that you will not learn outside the ravings of an ancient mad man who is afraid of nothing. The truth leads me and you beyond ourselves. When I was a young man and in the time of my father and his father's brothers Riija was followed and studied, and its ways were strong and open for all to study or worship. But three score and ten years have passed since the high priests and priestesses of Kraanan decided to eradicate the followers of Riija, to trail and to kill any poor soul that followed the ways of The Chronicler. And they did,, and after two score years of killings and slaughter even the families of those that followed Riija were gone with no trace, the libraries burnt and temples razed. And then no one spoke of it again. They were removed from this land while Faren slept and Shal'ille averted her judgment for her husband. But you cannot hide such a thing forever, and when Riija does come back my vision says the blood will begin again."
MarionElder		qor	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Speak not that name within my presence, for you do not understand the power of the words your voice makes. You must go, now. Search your soul, and think about what you find there."
MarionElder		jala	~kRan er'Hoth says, "The Jala magics are lost as a school. The power of these energies are random, unfocusable, and nature itself is out of balance without that focus, for all the other powers have it in abundance. But the power is not lost. The power is there waiting to resurface, with or without the guidance of practitioners. There are those around that understand enough of the old ways, that perhaps... "
MarionElder		king	~kRan er'Hoth says, "He always was a crafty man, Zarcos V. I understand that now he is in hiding, becrying that his wits have gone afoul, lost his marbles don't you know. But I wouldn't exactly count on that... he is a crafty man. Watch for him, for he is closer to the surface than he has been in nearly fifteen years, and if he is able, when he is able, he'll be making his move. Aye, and nearby he is, for I have seen that old goat Alzahakar lurking about... "
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "We offer our help to any person in need. Thus we but bringst the good works of Shal'ille to all peoples, and amongst the land itself. Nay, all are welcome within these walls good %SIRMADAM."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "Shal'ille is a goddess who demands the most rigorous devotion. Beware thee of her misguided disciples, who preach righteousness without compassion! Many are those that wouldst use her ways but for personal fortune and advancement."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "Within this land there are temples erected to the four gods and goddesses. 'Tis where the dedicated may go to study their teachings, yea for even the misguided may seek to worship."

MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "Resist the temptation of Qor, the mighty seductress. Blessed Shal'ille will guide us from her meddling schemes and but lead us from her false whispers, showing us the true path to harmonious nature."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "This is a holy house, dedicated to Blessed Shal'ille and to her good works wherein you may find some comfort."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "The continuance of our work here doth require that we ask for charitable donations, however modest, from those that seek our aid and can afford to be generous."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "To offer is to be generous to our Blessed Shal'ille, and 'tis meet you should, for every shilling spent thus will be again bestowed upon thee twenty-fold."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "There is sickness o'er all the land that Shal'ille desires to mend with her compassionate ways. But four gods now rule where once there were six, and the very order of nature hath been disturbed."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "We have a great responsibility to find what ails the land and to restore its balance, ere all is lost. The guidance of Shal'ille is yet the answer to our silent prayers."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "The Blessed Sanctuary of Gentle Rains is the first house dedicated entirely to healing and to the compassion of our Lady of Tenderness Shal'ille, yet we soon hope to spread her work throughout the land with many such houses, and the devoted to work therein."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "We have much work yet to heal the wounds that are leveled upon the land."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "As you can see, our work here has been quite successful and will continue under the strict guidance of Our Lady of Peace, and of course the generosity of so many blessed with Her kindness."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "What ails thee, %NAME?"
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "We are but here to serve."
MarionHealer		hello	~kLady Aftyn says, "The blessing of Shal'ille upon thee, and thine own."
MarionHealer		bye	~kLady Aftyn says, "Shal'ille will light thy path, and thine heart."
MarionHealer		barloque	~kLady Aftyn says, "Barloque was once my home, far from this time and this place. I think not upon it now except as the home of my children."
MarionHealer		cor NOTH	~kLady Aftyn says, "A city condemn'd, but not upon its nature or its sins. Within Cor Noth is a desecrated temple, Oh Tears of Shal'ille! Our Tender Lady Shal'ille placed a temple in the center of Cor Noth, upon the site of an ancient, holy place. 'Tis known as Ivory Chapel, contained in the most holy of manuscripts."
MarionHealer		jasper	~kLady Aftyn says, "There is much work to be done in Jasper, for they are an ungodly people."
MarionHealer		marion	~kLady Aftyn says, "Marion is my new home, and the has proved the ideal setting for our work for The Blessed Sanctuary of Gentle Rains. The people are kind, for poverty breeds compassion amongst them."
MarionHealer		tos	~kLady Aftyn says, "There is great evil in Tos, wherein nature's balance has been thrown aside. Were I a great healer and myself capable of such a feat, I wouldst but gather Tos to my bosom and heal the city itself."
MarionHealer		duke	~kLady Aftyn says, "Kalior is dead, and I fear that Akardius is as corrupt as his predecessor."
MarionHealer		princess	~kLady Aftyn says, "The Princess has grown quite beautifully and should be able to overcome the new challenges which face her."
MarionHealer		jonas	~kLady Aftyn, Jonas is a good man, he saw that things had to change.  ''Tis a good sight more than others have done lately."
MarionHealer		council	~kLady Aftyn says, "The Council are much revered, for by and large the are amongst the most learned men in the land. Now without the King that placed them thus they are unfounded in authority and their great wisdom mislaid."
MarionHealer		ivory chapel	~kLady Aftyn says, "Merchant-knaves have but stolen it, and desecrated the place by letting it to groups of any belief or following, as though it were but a market stall or a farmers' barn! 'Tis is a great shame on our Lady of Compassion and Her Most Benign Ways. But there is remedy yet. We at The Blessed Sanctuary of Gentle Rains endeavor to raise the money, if need be, to buy back the property for the Guild Master Frular of Barloque."
MarionHealer		zarcos 	~kLady Aftyn says, "What's this? What of his Majesty?"
MarionHealer		meidei	~kLady Aftyn says, "'Tis a false visage of Shal'ille that that man praises, one that he has invented himself. I have had occasion to speak with him thus, but he will not see light of his error nor mend his profane ways. Say you a prayer for him if he is on your mind, for he is lost."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "Now go forth with the Blessing of Our Gentle Lady Shal'ille."
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "Shal'ille tends to you for your kindness, and for the gracious love of all of Her benefactors."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Drink! Eat! Rest up here while you can, you'll ~Ineed~I your schtrength for fighting monschters and BAD people in her..out there! ~Ihic~I!"
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "I have HEARD, ~Ihic~I, that a great warrior reschides in Cor Noth, a maschter warrior don't shou know. He wuz the ~Icaptain of the Royal Guardz, okay? He is schupposed to know all that there iz to know about battling monschsters, and demonz, and schuch... "
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Barloque iz the royal capitol of all the land outschide Jasper, and a place overwhelming with wealth. Aschk Yevitan about it, he usched to LIVE there."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Schtay away from the trollz in thesche hillz, they are deadly. DEADLY. The orcz too, becauze they will schometimez form ~IWAR PARTIES~I and ~Iraid~I the human townz! Yes! ~Ivery~I dangerouz!"
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Pick your path out of Jasper carefully, stranger. The road to the east is infested with an army of trolls and orcs, enough to challenge any army the freggin' flatlands could raise."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "People in these parts aren't like the rest of Meridian folks. It's a breed apart up here, and you'd best be mindful of the differences.  Especially now with Joans and his gang, they don't like noone talking bad bout them."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "We didn't used to get so many strangers up here in the mountains.  Wish that damned Jonas and his guppies never thought to come here."
JasperBartender			~kPietro is waiting to take your order.
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "There is a bank here in Jasper, just around the corner. It is left over from the days that the freggin' mines prospered."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Hey, you gonna buy a beer, or what? This isn't a freggin' flophouse!!!"
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "If you're here to drink and eat, then drink and eat. I don't have time for your damned conversation."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "You're better off by not asking too many questions in these parts. We like our privacy."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Money freggin' talks in this land, so you better figure out how to freggin' get it."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "You might be surprised at what you can find out by just listening."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "I don't care where you sleep, but you're not sleeping here."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "I could ~Itell~I you a few thinzz about thiz town that would ~Imake~I your hairz schtand on their enz. Thazz RIGHT. On their freggin' enz."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Schtart aschking questions around here, and you don't ever know what you might turn up. Probably ~Iwouldn't~I WANT to know, neither."
JasperBartender			~kPietro grumbles, "It used to be nice and queit round these here parts.  Haven't been this many loafers round since the mines dried up."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "We like things the way they are in these parts."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "You don't want to freggin' start no trouble here."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "~IHit~I the freggin' ROAD."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "You ~Iwatch~I your step around here, stranger. Schomeone will freggin' hit you over the freggin' HEAD and take your money. Even ~Ihappenz to localz~I, you can believe me there, scho don't go thinking you're ANYTHING FRIGGIN' SCHPECIAL... "

JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Yevitan, now he'z a wize old bugger. He'z got planz, BIG planz, but he wazn't schaying nothing till that Jonz, Jonarc, whatz hiz face came round. Schmart guy."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "~IHic~I."

JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Did you need something? No? No? Well then, you freggin' get going."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "If I wuz you, dungface, I'd walk out of here while you still can."
JasperBartender			~kPietro says, "Hit the brickz, you freggin' road trash. Pietroz iz C-L-O-S-E-D."
JasperBartender			~kPietro screams, "WHAT!?!"

JasperBartender			~kPietro shouts, "The bar iz closed. Get out."
JasperBartender		hello	~kPietro abruptly says, "Yes, WHAT?!?"
JasperBartender		hello	~kPietro says, "What do you want?"
JasperBartender		bye	~kPietro glances up to watch you leave.
JasperBartender		bye	~kPietro says, "Humpf."
JasperBartender		bye	~kPietro says, "Thazz right, get on out. Go on. OUT!!!"
JasperBartender		quintor	~kPietro says, "He'z doing better than ever before, better than anyone elze in thiz town if you know what I mean. But I guez you don't, or you wouldn't be azking. Okay, let me schpell it out for you. He should be doing freggin' fine, since he freggin' murdered old man Qesino and moved in with hiz freggin' wife! Don't you think you'd be doing pretty freggin' well if you freggin' murdered old man Qesino and moved in with hiz freggin' wife!?!"
JasperBartender		quintor	~kPietro says, "He's the blacksmith in these parts. He's just across the way, and if you've got business with him you should discuss it with him."
JasperBartender		quintor	~kPietro says, "I don't want to freggin' know, and if you know whaz good for you, neither do you. But if you want the real schtory on Quintor, find his freggin' ex-wife! HA! You can bet sche'z with that miner sche ran off with, if you can find her, that iz. Bring a shovel when you go looking, becauze you'll have to dig up half this mountain to find them both. Might have to usche your imagination too, 'cause the piecez might not fit together scho good... that's what I mean by if you know what'z good for you... "
JasperBartender		widow	~kPietro says, "Oh. yes, the bereaving widow. She'z so freggin' broken up about her husband'z dizappearance, that she freggin' shacked up with the blacksmith!! Thick as thieves, thaz right, thick as freggin' thieves. But you didn't hear that from me... "
JasperBartender		widow	~kPietro says, "She runs the inn, just down the street."
JasperBartender		widow	~kPietro says, "You ask too many questions, stranger, schticking your noze around where you got no biznez. Why don't you leave Jasper while you still got a noze on your freggin' face."
JasperBartender		qesino	~kPietro says, "Dizappeared on hiz way to Toz. Vanished into thin air, becuz thaz what we have up here in the mountainz, thin air. If you ask me though, and you did, his friggin' widow and her friggin' blacksmith boyfriend killed him, left hiz body up there in the freggin' mountainz, murdered him and took all the money he wuz headed to Toz with. Becauze he had a bundle with him, and that dizappeared too. HA!"
JasperBartender		qesino	~kPietro says, "He left town."
JasperBartender		qesino	~kPietro looks at you for a long moment, shaking his head.
JasperBartender		yevitan	~kPietro says, "That old man haz got hiz own planz, that I know. Did you know that in hiz younger, ~Ihic~I, hiz younger dayz he was the ~IFinancial Minischter~I to~Ithe King~I? Thaz RIGHT. ~Ipowerful~I man.

JasperInnKeeper			~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Bless you."
JasperInnKeeper			~kThe Widow Qesino says, "You must leave here."
JasperInnKeeper		hello	~kThe Widow Qesino smiles at you warmly.
JasperInnKeeper		bye	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Oh, no, you mustn't leave now... it isn't safe to travel the mountains at night."
JasperInnKeeper		hello	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Welcome."
JasperInnKeeper		hello	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Come in and warm yourself near the fire."
JasperInnKeeper		bye	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Good %DAYNIGHT to you."
JasperInnKeeper		barloque	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I know that Barloque is the home of Meridians' royal family. Our own Yevitan, at the Royal Bank here in Jasper, was a close advisor the King Zarcos IV and lived there for many years before he came back to Jasper."
JasperInnKeeper		barloque	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Although I have yet to travel to Barloque, it is sure to be very grand."
JasperInnKeeper		cor NOTH	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Cor Noth is due north and on the plains. They are very idealistic people there."
JasperInnKeeper		cor NOTH	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I'm afraid I've never been to Cor Noth. I'm sure it is a very decent place."
JasperInnKeeper		jasper	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "This town will make a name for itself yet.  Now that we have Jonas and his rebels here they can't just ignore us any longer."
JasperInnKeeper		jasper	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "The talk is really picking up here. I wonder if there will be action behind those words."
JasperInnKeeper		marion	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "My sister and her husband settled in Marion after the mines closed. It is a lovely town. The people there are very witty, yes, always making jokes."
JasperInnKeeper		marion	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Marion is just out of the mountains, on the other side of the great forest of Farol. Yes, some of the farmers from those parts come up to Jasper regularly to sell their goods at market."
JasperInnKeeper		tos	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yevitan at the Royal Bank here in Jasper used to work closely with another bank, which is in Tos. You can do business with either one. My late husband didn't trust Yevitan, and would make the trip to Tos just to conduct business. He... well, when he left here for Tos the last time, he went missing. Never showed up in Tos, and no one has seen him here."
JasperInnKeeper		tos	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, it's a big city north of here some distance. My late husband frequently traveled there on business."
JasperInnKeeper		duke	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I shed no tears for Kalior."
JasperInnKeeper		duke	~kThe Widow Qesino snorts, I'm sure we're just an after-thought to him, if he thinks of us at all."
JasperInnKeeper		duke	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "That whelp thought he had his hold on us didn't he. He found out the hard way that he was dead wrong."
JasperInnKeeper		princess	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Bless her heart, she is left to look after the throne when the land is in such a ~Imess~I, from what I understand. Goes to show you that happiness does not come with great wealth and power."
JasperInnKeeper		princess	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "She seems very kind, naive, but kind."
JasperInnKeeper		princess	~kThe Widow Qesino says, Can't much see her highness hiking up her skirts and strolling through the mountains to Jasper."
JasperInnKeeper		jonas	~kThe Widow Qesino says, He's a good man at heart, almost fits in with us mountain folk."
JasperInnKeeper		jonas	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I'm not really sure if he is our salvation or latest downfall, it's a tossup really."
JasperInnKeeper		council	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "They are very wise, I know that, but what can they do for all these troubles? People need to take more on themselves, take control of their own lives."
JasperInnKeeper		council	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "The politics of the council are far removed from the simple life we lead in Jasper."
JasperInnKeeper		quintor	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, he is a boarder here and he runs the blacksmith shop just across the way. A very fine blacksmith too, as you can see for yourself, he has made many of the things here at the inn."
JasperInnKeeper		quintor	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, Quintor is the blacksmith in Jasper. His shop is just across the way, if you need any metalwork."
JasperInnKeeper		afiera d'xor	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, he is a longtime resident of Jasper."
JasperInnKeeper		zhieu b'hob	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Do you know him?"
JasperInnKeeper		yevitan	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "He is a very clever businessman, he was once a close advisor to the King on such matters. That is quite an accomplishment for someone from Jasper, because we are looked down upon by the people from other towns."
JasperInnKeeper		yevitan	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, that is the banker in Jasper. An honest man."
JasperInnKeeper		pietro	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, Pietro... well, he has a little problem with his drinking."
JasperInnKeeper		pietro	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "He runs the tavern. He should still be open, you'll find it just up the street."
JasperInnKeeper		troll	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Trolls are ~Ivery~I wicked."
JasperInnKeeper		orc	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Yes, the orcs cause many problems for those who must travel in these mountains."
JasperInnKeeper		assassin	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "An ~Iassassin~I? Who was assassinated?"
JasperInnKeeper		murder	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Murder? Someone was ~Imurdered~I?"
JasperInnKeeper		kill	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Who got ~Ikilled~I?"
JasperInnKeeper		husband	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "My husband disappeared some time ago. He has been missing these many months, and they told me he was presumed dead when they gave up the search."
JasperInnKeeper		husband	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I am a widow."
JasperInnKeeper		rebels	~kThe Widow Qesino says, It's about time Jasper had a regular militia, specially with all them city folk wandering about as of late."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "Have you been to Tos, stranger? In Tos there is a grand arena, where Meridians' greatest warriors often test their skills against each other in a trial by combat."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "If you'll take my advice, don't believe half of what you hear in this town. And watch your step, if you think that the creatures in these hills are treacherous you don't know the half of it until you've gotten yourself on the wrong side of the people of Jasper."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "My reputation as a weaponsmith speaks for itself. Ask around, the finest sword steel in the land comes out of this forge."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "I am in the business of selling metalware. Is there something specific you are wondering about?"
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "You must be new to these parts."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "You look a little lightly armed to be traveling in these mountains, stranger. Even the idiots in this town know that these hills are perilous, and you won't get any second chances."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor hisses, "Are you stupid? I am asking you to leave."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "I am too busy to waste another moment on you. Get you gone."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "There is a different wisdom to the people in these hills than the other peoples of Meridian. You would never get their trust to find it out, but the people of the Cragged Mountains know how to survive. Afiera D'xor is a wise man. Go and see him, stranger."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "I heard from a traveler recently that a new Queen Spider is active in the Twisted Woods. An adventurer I knew once went after her eggs, on account of the price of those things. She never made it out, though, and the story ends there."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "The people of Jasper were once completely independent of the rest of Meridian, with our own laws, and government. In the time of my great grandfather we were a separate state, with an appointed Warlord called a Wryn. You can still see the warlord's fortress, The Wryn's Keep, at the edge of town, although now it is rented to outsiders by some businessman in ~IBarloque~I."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "Someday soon I believe the Wryn's Keep will be returned to its rightful owners, the people of Jasper. Someday very soon that cretin Frular will get his... "
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "If you want to improve your weapon skills, seek out opponents that are worthy of a good fight. You won't get anywhere fighting opponents that are beneath you."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "Can I show you anything in particular?"
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "What do you need?"
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "Are you here about some specific business, stranger?"
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "You waste my time, beggar. Be on your way."
JasperBlacksmith		hello	~kQuintor says, "Yes, can I help you?"
JasperBlacksmith		hello	~kQuintor says, "Good %DAYNIGHT, stranger."
JasperBlacksmith		hello	~kQuintor says, "What do you want, beggar?"
JasperBlacksmith		bye	~kQuintor says, "Come back and see me when you're in these parts."
JasperBlacksmith		bye	~kQuintor says, "Begone."
JasperBlacksmith		whiskey	~kQuintor says testily, "Well, I don't know anything about any no Troll Whiskey."
JasperBlacksmith		barloque	~kQuintor says, "The fancy manners and dress of Barloque are a long way from Jasper, I assure you."
JasperBlacksmith		barloque	~kQuintor says, "I've never been to the city of Barloque, so I'd be the wrong person to ask."
JasperBlacksmith		barloque	~kQuintor says, "This is Jasper. If you want to know about Barloque, beggar, head north until you get to the coast, then go east until you reach a sewer surrounded by walls. You can't miss it."
JasperBlacksmith		cor NOTH	~kQuintor says, "They've got their heads stuck firmly in the ground in Cor Noth, to be sure. ~IUniversity~I. You would learn more in a week in these mountains than a lifetime at their so called ~Iuniversity~I."
JasperBlacksmith		cor NOTH	~kQuintor says, "Although I have been to the city of Cor Noth, I was there as a visitor only. I know little of those people and their ways."
JasperBlacksmith		cor NOTH	~kQuintor says, "Cor Noth? Well, I'd say it'd be a fine place for ~Ione~I such as you."
JasperBlacksmith		jasper	~kQuintor says, "I'll say this, it was a different place before the mines failed and all those outsiders left town, and now that Jonas is here with his so called ~Ifaction~I. But the people of Jasper have always been here, and always will. You could spend your life in Jasper and still not find out much about it, stranger. Sometimes it's better to let sleeping dogs lie."
JasperBlacksmith		jasper	~kQuintor says, "Take it face value, stranger. Just a sleepy mountain community where life is pretty simple."
JasperBlacksmith		jasper	~kQuintor says, "Not your cup of tea, eh? Just as well you figured it out the easy way."
JasperBlacksmith		marion	~kQuintor says, "The people of Marion are complacent and stubborn. That's probably because all they have to contend with down on the flatlands are baby spiders and giant rats. No trolls, no orcs. Life must be pretty easy."
JasperBlacksmith		marion	~kQuintor says, "Marion? Not much to say about it, it's just north where the land flattens out."
JasperBlacksmith		marion	~kQuintor says, "I don't care about Marion, its problems, or your opinions on any of it. I think you were just leaving."
JasperBlacksmith		tos	~kQuintor says, "I don't care for the Tos people. They are blind followers, unable to fully think for themselves."
JasperBlacksmith		tos	~kQuintor says, "Tos is at the center of all of the idleness that plagues this land. You probably know more about it than I do."
JasperBlacksmith		tos	~kQuintor says, "I've got nothing to say about Tos, so if you're that curious perhaps you should go and see for ~Iyourself~I."
JasperBlacksmith		wife	~kQuintor says, "My wife left these parts years ago, when the mines dried up. I... well, I haven't seen her for some time now."
JasperBlacksmith		wife	~kQuintor says, "That's my business, and none of your affair."
JasperBlacksmith		wife	~kQuintor says, "Are you asking me about my business? Who have you been talking to? I think that you should leave here."
JasperBlacksmith		duke	~kQuintor says, "This Duke Akardius is as much a fool as Kalior. Meridian needs an honorable warrior, such as Jonas, to take the throne."
JasperBlacksmith		duke	~kQuintor says, "I don't know much about him."
JasperBlacksmith		duke	~kQuintor says, "I think you should take your political opinions out of my shop, NOW!"
JasperBlacksmith		princess	~kQuintor says, "I'd rather discuss something else, if it's all the same to you."
JasperBlacksmith		princess	~kQuintor says, "I haven't got an opinion about her at all."
JasperBlacksmith		princess	~kQuintor bellows, "The affairs of the Princess have absolutely no bearing in these parts, so if you have an opinion why don't you keep it to yourself!"
JasperBlacksmith		council	~kQuintor says, "I would rather not discuss politics."
JasperBlacksmith		council	~kQuintor says, "I an too busy to try and keep up with politics."
JasperBlacksmith		council	~kQuintor says, "So what about them then? I don't have anything to say to you!"
JasperBlacksmith		orc	~kQuintor says, "Many think of them as a backwards race, but that is the ignorance of those that have not dealt with them firsthand. In these mountains, if you happen to run into an orc it will most likely be a lone warrior, but even alone orcs are formidable fighters and you must watch yourself. No one knows where their central fortress is or what happens there, but you can be sure that they are waiting for the time to come out in force, for they are capable of organizing and fielding large armies. When that day comes, we will all know it."
JasperBlacksmith		orc	~kQuintor says, "The orcs are fearsome creatures that live up in these mountains. I have heard that there is also another breed that stays almost entirely underground, but that they are related in both blood and spirit."
JasperBlacksmith		orc	~kQuintor says, "I am a blacksmith, not some soldier. Go about your business and leave me alone."
JasperBlacksmith		frular	~kQuintor says, "This man, Frular of Barloque, is alive without a soul or ancestors of merit. His business is to buy property and buildings all across the land in order to rent them for profit. BUT... this man Frular of Barloque especially wishes to acquire buildings that are sacred to their communities, and then defile them with his business dealings. He bought Wryn's Keep here in Jasper, which is the traditional fortress of the mountain warlord, and a Shal'ille temple in Cor Noth that I know of. Someday I will show him how wrong this is."
JasperBlacksmith		sell	~kQuintor says, "I have something that you must see."
JasperBlacksmith		sell	~kQuintor says, "I might have something you'd be interested in."
JasperBlacksmith		sell	~kQuintor says, "I don't have anything you'd be interested in!"
JasperBlacksmith		teach	~kQuintor says, "I might be able to teach you a few things about the scimitar. It is a unique weapon in its balance and weight, and requires dedication if you wish to master its subtlety. Perhaps I can help you begin your studies."
JasperBlacksmith		teach	~kQuintor says, "It's true that I will occasionally take a pupil."
JasperBlacksmith		teach	~kQuintor angrily says, "I'm not taking pupils!"
JasperBlacksmith		scimitar	~kQuintor says, "The scimitar is the sword of the orcish hoards, a large, curve bladed weapon that is a fearsome weapon in the hands of those who have the skill. I have learned a few things wielding such a blade. Occasionally I will take a pupil under my wing and teach them some basic points."
JasperBlacksmith		scimitar	~kQuintor says, "The scimitar is an orcish blade, very advanced in its design. It puts to rest any ideas that those unfamiliar with the orcs often have about the orcs being a backwards race."
JasperBlacksmith		scimitar	~kQuintor says, "I don't know anything about the scimitar."
JasperBlacksmith		axe	~kQuintor says, "It's a great thing to have if you're gathering firewood, but to carry as a weapon? The graveyards in these hills are crowded with axe-carrying fools from the flatlands that went up against the orcish scimitar."
JasperBlacksmith		hammer	~kQuintor says, "I wouldn't make a hammer to act as a weapon, and I don't know a respectable warrior that would fight with one either. A hammer, really. I know a few farmers that would try to fight with a hammer, but not a warrior. And I've known a few of the best."
JasperBlacksmith		mace	~kQuintor says, "A mace is a child's weapon, better suited to crushing grapes than to actually fighting."
JasperBlacksmith		dagger	~kQuintor says, "A toy."
JasperBlacksmith		sword	~kQuintor says, "The sword is a warrior's weapon, and I have made my share."
JasperBlacksmith		widow qesino	~kQuintor says, "You would do well to avoid rumor-mongering and state your business."
JasperBlacksmith		pietro	~kQuintor says, "If you have business with Pietro, I suggest that you take it up with him."
JasperBlacksmith		yevitan	~kQuintor says, "I don't know what you're after, but Yevitan's business is his own, as mine is my own and your business best kept to yourself."
JasperBlacksmith		zhieu b'hob	~kQuintor says, "This is a blacksmith's shop, not a gossip parlor. You will learn to mind your own business in this town."
JasperBlacksmith		afiera d'xor	~kQuintor says, "You'd best talk to Afiera D'xor if that's who you want to talk about."
JasperBlacksmith		widow	~kQuintor says, "Get out of my shop."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "An old man learns ways to survive, or he doesn't ever become an old man at all. If you need to get away with murder, and sooner or later everybody does, it's a good idea that nobody sees you. I know a trick for that. But its Qor magic, and you need to have some understanding of The Deceiver to use it."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "You will find that everybody knows a different side of the story. To the shrewd political operative all of this information is important, provided that you catalogue it for future use. The key, my friend, is how you ask and the mood of the person to whom you inquire. And, naturally, whatever you can do to improve that mood is of paramount importance... "
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "All of this political turmoil between the Duke Kalilor and the young Princess seems to have a lot of citizens upset. And rightfully so! People need a proper government, that they can look up to, admire, and respect.  Just like what Jonas and I are trying to bring to the land now."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "It's an uncertain world, but you can keep your financial status quite secure by keeping your money in this institution."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Adventuring about is fine, but at the end of the day you need to consider your financial situation! Money defines the world within which we live, my friend. The ~Ioperating~I world."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "A young, industrious person like yourself can earn favor by running errands, carrying messages and the like for people between the towns of Meridian."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Do you bring news? Is that what you are doing here, little messenger gnat? News from the kingdom? Bah, you bore me. Get thee gone, imp."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Has the Duke sent you to bother me to death, is that why you are still here? He is a man of such unremarkable talents it would surprise me to find out he had hired someone's village idiot to monopolize my time now that I no longer have any ties to him.  He just can't stand that someone has broken free of his slimy little grip can he?"
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Have you spoken with Hester Gilk in Cor Noth? She has resources you might find useful, at some point in your travels... "
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "There is too much focus on the Duke and the Princess. People are failing to see the truth of the situation, which is that neither of those two parties is suitable to rule! That's right, unsuitable. I'm an old man, with the courage to admit it. I know our people realize this but everyone is afraid to see the truth, and certainly afraid to say a word. What kind of political situation is that?"
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "There is even more trouble than before, now that Akardius is Duke. He and the Princess it appears are back at square one. The conflict begins anew.  The perfect time for a new player to enter the game, eh?"
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Who will be the next King or Queen of this land? Look around you my friend. You? If your country calls to you, would you step forward to lead? Well then, I will tell you that it will not be me, that I can tell you, for I am an old man and my skills are better used to guide than to govern... but I will tell you this, I will have plenty to say about who it is. Remember that, and remember that Jonas has my full support."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Any deposit that you make remains safe here in my vaults, no matter what may befall the depositor. That is the policy of the Royal Bank of Jasper, and you have my word on it as a businessman."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "It is a hard world my friend, one in which, I am afraid, your net worth to the powers that be may be tabulated as easily as counting beans. One, two, three, four, etc., etc.. That is the reality of a political system based solely upon economic constructs. We aren't asked whether or not we like it this way, but this is how we must live until we summon the strength to make a change."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "It's true that I spent many years in the service of our last King, Zarcos V before settling into this business. I believe now that a private life suits me better than the atmosphere of the Royal Court. There is too much posturing over pedigrees and privilege in the Court."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "There are those even now who live in the sentimental delusion that Konima will return to this kingdom and deliver us from our present woes! Gone these two hundred and twenty some years, and he'll return now to dig us out of the mess that we've gotten ourselves into! Imagine?"
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "It is wise to stock up on all of your essentials before leaving Jasper, to ensure your safe passage through the mountains. Jasper is not a large town by any means, but the quality of our goods is unsurpassed."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "There are so many new travelers in our land, and so much new opportunity. We are poised on the brink of a changing world, my friend."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "If you want my advice, which you seem to young %SIRMADAM, I would advise you to keep your banking business confined within these four walls. You may make up your own mind about the situation, but I feel that Skivlat at the First Royal Bank in Tos is not as ~Idiligent~I as he could be. He strikes me as a bit of the strange type, you see. Quite strange indeed."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "As if it were not enough that I am plagued by the Gerah Springers and Herbuttes of this world, you choose to occupy my time and my place of business for whatever senseless reason that you might have. Go on. I am an old man in Jasper, for Qor's sake, and I really don't have time for you."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Are you wasting my time? Go and speak your mind with Joguer, I haven't the patience for thee and thine own."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "As my dear friend King Zarcos V always said to me, 'Spare the luxuries to spoil the savings'. That is royal advice, [lad, lassie], but didn't I train him well?"
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Jasper shall be bigger than ever...very soon."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Qor smiles upon businessmen and rebels, for you see there is a system even to breaking the system... "
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "How lovely to see you again, %NAME! I sincerely hope you have been prosperous in the meanwhile, and have managed to avoid the Duke and his band of cutthroats."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "If you deposit your money here at the Royal Bank, you may also conduct business on your account at the First Royal Bank in Tos, for both although the Duke no longer owns both institutions, I find it much more calming to my customers that the banks work together."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "I certainly hope that you don't mistake the tentative nature of the Jasper people for unfriendliness. On the contrary, these are good, strong people who are excellent at recognizing that which is best, and the worst, of outsiders."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "You must always consider your equity, my friend."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Yes, can I help you? Some financial advice perhaps?"
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Do you have a deposit today, %NAME?"
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "What can I do for you, %NAME?"
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "This is a bank, not a fishmonger's shack. Take your gossip elsewhere, I have business to attend to."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "What do you require, outsider?"
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "If you have business with the bank today, kindly conduct that business and we can both get on with our other obligations."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Look, I don't have time to chat with you. I don't care to anyway, so get out of here. Go on. Get."
JasperBanker		hello	~kYevitan says, "Yes? What is it that I can do for you?"
JasperBanker		bye	~kYevitan says, "Good bye."
JasperBanker		barloque	~kYevitan says, "Ah, yes, Barloque was my home for many years while I was in service to the King. At one point it was the seat of imperial power in Meridian, though now a ghost of a city sits in its' place. Ghostly remnants. It's no longer the center of anything, except Meridian's own sewer system."
JasperBanker		barloque	~kYevitan says, "I lived for years in Barloque, but now I'm happy to be back among my people here. Never really felt that I fit in there, that I belonged to the place. Perhaps it is the way that they speak there, they have a strange way of speaking, you know, elitist. In any event, it isn't very welcoming."
JasperBanker		barloque	~kYevitan says, "'Tis a gilded cage, that forsaken city. A velvet prison tended by a gang of thieves and in-bred imbeciles, where sense is a liability and an honest opinion is dangerous to those that expressed it. Begone now, I'll say no more. I am weary of you."
JasperBanker		cor NOTH	~kYevitan says, "To tell you the truth, I never go there for any reason, but the reasons are entirely personal. You see, I cannot go to Cor Noth without running into that little rodent Parrin Aragone, a man I have never been able to tolerate in any amount."
JasperBanker		cor NOTH	~kYevitan says, "Well, not my favorite city personally."
JasperBanker		cor NOTH	~kYevitan says, "What about it? You are irritating me with your inane questions."
JasperBanker		jasper	~kYevitan says, "Well, it is a curious place to the outsider. . . but it is a place of great potential. Huh? Great ~Ipotential~I. A tougher people do not exist anywhere. Or a more loyal people. And loyalty means everything in this world, with all it's twists and turns, and twisting around. These people are coming out of the mountains, and defining the political future of this land."
JasperBanker		marion	~kYevitan says, "Marion fits key into the political landscape of Meridian, although you would never guess it by judging its sleepy appearances. Marion is a royalist stronghold, loyal to the King."
JasperBanker		marion	~kYevitan says, "A very modest region, with rather modest ambition and means."
JasperBanker		marion	~kYevitan says, "What? Marion? Why do you waste my time with your incessant chatter? I'm just trying to run a bank here."
JasperBanker		army	~kYevitan says, "You may want to see Jonas about that."
JasperBanker		tos	~kYevitan says, "Well... Tos is a rather old fashioned city with a rather fashionable political climate, if you know what I mean. The people of Tos are more concerned with the appearance of taking action than they are with actually taking action themselves, or with the consequences. It's a simple place, really. Full of... well, simpletons."
JasperBanker		tos	~kYevitan says, "Hmmm? Tos? It was alive and well last time I passed through the gates."
JasperBanker		tos	~kYevitan says, "You ask too many questions for your own good."
JasperBanker		duke	~kYevitan says, "You want to talk about that no good, self aggrandizing, pompous fool? That man is no more concerned for this land and its citizens than you or I concern ourselves with the fate of another baby spider, one way or the other. Well, he'll never be a King, that's certain. And if the issue is ever in doubt I'll see to it myself, by the gods I will. If that day comes, I'll take care of him myself... "
JasperBanker		duke	~kYevitan says, "Yea. What about the inane little dribbler?"
JasperBanker		duke	~kYevitan snarls, What?  I don't owe anything to that little Riija puppy.  I've paid my debt to his Uncle, and I have the records to prove it too."
JasperBanker		princess	~kYevitan says, "Although she has many endearing qualities, I can tell you with confidence that the quality of leadership is not among them. Certainly royalty has its place in this kingdom, but I insist that we are ready for more dynamic leadership. I suggest this in your utmost confidence, but when the time comes for an army to march down from these hills to instill a new King or Queen to the throne, where will you be, my friend?"
JasperBanker		princess	~kYevitan says, "Most courteous and understanding, qualities that she inherited from her late mother, the late Queen Katria."
JasperBanker		princess	~kYevitan says, A nice girl, but a girl is all she is.  She'll never had the spine nor the wit to make a competent ruler."
JasperBanker		jonas	~kYevitan says, Ah, as fine a man as I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.  Strong willed, sound of mind, and with such a glorious vision.  He has my full support."
JasperBanker		council	~kYevitan says, "Impotent old men."
JasperBanker		council	~kYevitan says, "Sort of an interim government, I suppose."
JasperBanker		council	~kYevitan says, "What now? Council? Go on, knave, out!"
JasperBanker		whiskey	~kYevitan says, "Troll whiskey? Listen to me and listen good, you'd better just get right on out of here before there's trouble."
JasperBanker		king	~kYevitan says, "Well, understand that he is a very old friend, regardless of how he was as a ruler for this kingdom. He wasn't particularly well suited to be King ever, too sensitive, too vulnerable. He is in a safe place now. You realize he'd better be, for if he shows his face he is a dead man. There are powerful people in this land who cannot afford to have him making unexpected appearances."
JasperBanker		king	~kYevitan says, "The King is in hiding. Exiled, hiding, whatever you choose to call it. But you would know that already, for that news common knowledge."
JasperBanker		king	~kYevitan says, "Are you asking me where the King is? Is that what you want to know? Bah! Even if I knew what makes you think I would tell you? Take thee away, fool. I haven't the energy for you and your prattle."
JasperBanker		zig	~kYevitan looks at you very closely.
JasperBanker		denthan	~kYevitan says, "Ah, yes, the great battle of Denthan Crossing. It is a turning point in our history; that is the history of the Jasper people, for it marks the end of our independence when the Wryn's army was defeated there by the forces of Zarcos II. But true to the spirit of the Jasper people, it also marked the end of Zarcos II. My people saw to that. He never left that field."
JasperBanker		tova	~kYevitan says, "A remarkable man... not what he appears, I assure you."
JasperBanker		frular	~kYevitan says, "There are many in this kingdom with a critical eye on Frular of Barloque. And I will not stand here and say that this is unwarranted. But say what you will about him, he is a genius at making investments that in turn make money. Genius. I have never seen the like of the man, even Bei Naq on his best day, which was of course years before you were even born... "
JasperBanker		obert cair'bre	~kYevitan says, "Master Cair'bre is a most upstanding gentleman, and a personal friend of mine for some years. I would trust my every possession to his care without any hesitation, regardless of its' value."
JasperBanker		herbutte	~kYevitan says, "Herbutte? That pompous boob. The Royal Court is full of his like, pretentious toadies squirming past each other for table scraps. And I should know, because for all my years at Court, all of my dedicated service to His Majesty Zarcos V, it was people like this Herbutte who always made it a point to remind me that after all I was only from Jasper. ~IOnly~I from Jasper and therefore only fit for a temporary position among the so-called elite."
JasperBanker		meidei	~kYevitan says, "Strange fellow. Heard that he's become possessed by some fever of religious fanaticism. In the years that I knew him well, he served drinks and kept abreast of the local gossip. Tipped a few glasses back himself, as well. And now he has found Shal'ille? Well that should tell you something."
JasperBanker		joguer	~kYevitan says, "Haven't seen the man in years. Oh, must be ten years now at least. He was always a bit, you know, affected."
JasperBanker		justicar	~kYevitan says, "Now that's a new system since my time at Court. But what a laugh. A toothless position of no authority, open to the highest bidder. That's our justice? Oh, okay then... "
JasperBanker		gerah springers	~kYevitan says, "Yes, the Baron of Cor Noth or some such claptrap. Another of many within the Royal Court with nothing to do but exercise their boredom in public. Their time will come, though, you will see."
JasperBanker		qor	~kYevitan says, "There are reasons that all of our gods occupy the positions that they do. If you wish to find out more about Qor, I suggest that you seek out the Priestess Zuxana. She will instruct you as to where to begin your education."
JasperBanker		blindness	~kYevitan says, "Tell me, is this something that you have the dedication to pursue? Is this something that you have talked over with Zuxana? You must be very careful where you tread in these matters."
JasperBanker		zuxana	~kYevitan says, "She is a mystery. An immensely powerful mystery. For what moves Qor and his servants? That is a question I fear that no one can answer."
JasperBanker		lady aftyn	~kYevitan says, "Lady Aftyn is a loyal friend to Zarcos, and I must say that despite her beliefs a friend of my ally is a friend to me. I am watching her carefully."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Have you ever seen a so-called magic wand? A man I know, Fehr'loi Qan buys them and says he has a large collection up in Barloque. He told me he keeps them at his blacksmith shop. He won't say much more than that, though, he is a very quiet type. He used to live in Tos, and I would see him every couple of months when I was there on business, you know, we'd get together and play chess. But... he took his business moved north to Barloque, and I'll tell you what, it was probably the best thing he ever did, from a business standpoint anyway. Oh yes, he is making the shillings now! He'll probably be able to retire in a couple of years! Can you imagine? Retire in Barloque? And a relatively young guy too. I tell you what, he has it made."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "The guilds seem to offer a certain amount of protection to their members... and you know what? I'm starting to think that maybe we should form a merchant guild. That's right, a merchant guild, one that protects us merchants, what do you think about that? That's what we need alright. See, that way we could meet every so often decide issues, you know, the Big Issues. Like... okay, like what are our policies about prices? Or who do we serve, you know, where do we stand politically? Duke? Hmmm? Princess?  Jonas?  Is that the answer? I think that it would do us a lot of good to form a guild, that's right, get some of these issues out on the table and hammer them out, so to speak. I'd be willing to surrender some of my personal beliefs, if that's what it would take."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "A shilling saved is a shilling earned, you know what I mean? You're better off not carrying around too much cash, go and see Yevitan at the bank up the street. He'll keep your money safe, and you'll be able to make deposits and withdrawals from the Bank in Tos as well! Isn't that a good deal?"
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Just the basics in this town, %SIRMADAM. We'll get you what you need alright, just as long as it fits into the basic category."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "There's been quite a bit of activity between the guilds of late... not all of it good, either, in fact I'd say that most of it has been mischievous and that's no good, there's no place for people just behaving however they like, for Faren's sake."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "As my granny always said, a stitch in time saves nine! You'd best stock up on your necessary provisions here, stranger, the mountains can be unforgiving."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "If you go to Marion %NAME you have to go in the Limping Toad and have an ale with the proprietor, Tova. He is a funny, funny man."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Not too difficult to lose your way in these mountains and just disappear, really, happens to people who've spent their whole lives up here. Take Qesino, for instance, I mean whatever happened to him, he might as well have dropped off the face of the earth. And I'm sure he'd made that trip from here to Tos a thousand times with his money for the bank there, you know, he and Yevitan here had a falling out years back and neither of them ever got past that point, and he always took his money all the way to Tos to deposit, wouldn't set foot in the Royal Bank here to save his own life. Knock on wood."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "I say a prayer every day that the Princess is safe, but I can see how Jonas would make an excellent and prosperous King.  This political strife and fighting needs to end forever.  So that there will be justice, and peace, and that the orcs go way back into the mountains, and mind their own business back there forever. Because I think we need to have that kind of stability that a monarch provides, someone for everyone to look up to and admire, someone to have the final say on anything that comes up."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "How are you stocked up there for provisions? You know it's a mistake that a lot of people traveling in these hills make, is to not bring enough provisions along with them, because food will give you the energy that you need to survive out there. I know that the edge of survival can be that fine. My wife lost her brother to the mountains in just such a way. So take a look at what I've got here, and fill up your knapsack with what you have room for, you'll thank me for it later. You'll certainly thank me the next time that you're in my shop %NAME. And you'll thank me out there in the mountains."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Now don't go out into those mountains without dressing warmly enough, or you won't last longer than spit in the griddle. Take it from me, I've been up here my whole life. Now let me show you what I've got here, made from pure Jasper wool, which incidentally, anyone who knows anything at all about wool would tell you is absolutely the finest wool produced anywhere. You see, it's no secret that we have a tradition of raising the beautiful Jasper goats, like Aythya, just specifically for their hair, which you can see has a remarkable, lustrous quality, and will hold dye like nothing else. Just take a look, I don't have to sell woolen pants like these, they sell themselves, I'll tell you what. People come up here from all over the place, year after year, to get another pair. I bet you will too, [Player Name], after you try these on, I will be seeing you again very, very soon. Just watch."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "What's your opinion on the Justicar system? Yeah, well personally, I'll tell you what something needs to be done, with the King out of sight and who knows who coming and going from power! I'm glad, personally speaking now, that we people have some say in how criminals are dealt with! We can't wait for the Duke to get off his rear, no sir. None too soon, I say."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Actually, the people in this town can be downright rude, if you're not used to their ways. It's a wonder that anyone stops through Jasper at all. You would think that they would appreciate some meaningful contact with the rest of Meridian... business would certainly pick up, and Faren knows we could all use that... I don't know, %NAME, I've lived here my whole life and I can't figure it out. I guess it's just the way they are up here, I mean everyone is perfectly nice once you get to know them, it's mostly a matter of getting in at all, you know? Say for instance, how do you even start a conversation with Afiera D'xor if you're not from here? Hey, I've known him my whole life, he's practically a brother to my uncle and I can see how it would be hard. Believe me, I can see that %NAME."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "The other people of Meridian tend to see us Jasper folk as being... odd types, I guess, you know, somehow different. You get a lot of that."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "We've got a real nice inn here in Jasper, run by Qes... err, the Widow Qesino, and she does a great job. Good food too. Uh, yep... great food. Real warm inside too. Nice inn."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Jasper is renown for, among other things, our fine woolen products. You can't get pants like the kind I sell here anywhere else in the world."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "I've seen you in here before, %NAME, I'd swear on it. I never forget a face."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "You'll find that the prices are probably a bit higher up here in the mountains, but that's because we're pretty isolated up here. It's worth it though, %SIRMADAM, the quality of our goods is unparalleled."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Did you see the blacksmiths' shop just up the street?  Yes?  Well, Quintor may come off as being a bit stern at first, but he's a fine blacksmith. No, not what you'd call a conversationalist, but his weapons are recognized throughout the world as being the finest anywhere. Swords especially."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Can I interest you in something here? I'm sure we've got something here that you need... "
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "I hope that you don't take it personally if the people of Jasper seem, well, a bit reserved toward you, %SIRMADAM. That is just their way."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Did you know that Jasper was once the very heart of an independent mountain kingdom in Meridian? We had our own government and laws, and our own Overlord who sat upon a throne in The Wryn's Keep. But that was many ages ago, in the time of my grandfather's grandfather.  Although with Jonas taking over his own little faction it might become that way again some day soon."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Did you know that our own Yevitan, the banker here in Jasper, was once the Financial Minister under King Zarcos V? That's right, and that's no small accomplishment either, being a man from Jasper and all, because you rarely see a man or woman from Jasper that is allowed into those circles at all."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "You've no doubt heard that the King is in hiding, you know supposedly he had some kind of supposed mental failure, or whatever, and then he had to go into hiding to protect his well being. Okay, well everyone knows that. But do you know where he is? Well, I wouldn't be able to say that I know, but I have it on the highest authority that he is safe, and very nearby. I probably shouldn't sat anything about this at all, but I hear he's in Marion. Marion. I don't know where exactly, but Marion is what I hear."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "The problems of the working class are too often overlooked here, I mean who is looking out for the little guy in this land? Not the Duke, I'll tell you that much, and the Princess, well, I'm not sure that she has the experience yet that she'll need to become Queen. Someday soon, mind you, but not yet. You know what I mean. But those of us who are struggling just to keep bread on the table, make ends meet? Where do we turn in the face of all these troubles? Can you tell me that? Not likely, but I can. Jonas knows what it is liked to be shunned, he knows what it is like to have to work for every little bit that you have. To my mind that combination makes a better ruler than someone who never gets out into the world."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "You know %SIRMADAM, just this morning I was sweeping up here and thinking to myself how nice it would be to just close up my shop for a couple of days and just wander around a little, you know, maybe go down to Cor Noth, do a little shopping, something like that. I'll bet that's exactly what you do, move around a lot, am I right? It must be nice sometimes, although don't get me wrong I am grateful for what I have, still sometimes, you know, I wonder... "
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "I can sell you all the provisions that you need to get into, out of, and through these mountains, although I can't say safely. That, %SIRMADAM, is up to you. Keep your wits about you, because it's only that or Troll Whiskey that'll get you through."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "There's too much gossip in this town."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "There are many fine craftspeople and artists in Jasper. Our products are very valuable in other parts of this kingdom."
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "Oh, what's the use, %NAME? What is the use?"
JasperMerchant			~kZhieu B'hob says, "This is the place."
JasperMerchant		hello	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Hello, %NAME. Come in, what can I do for you?"
JasperMerchant		hello	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Good day to you, %SIRMADAM. What can I do for you today?"
JasperMerchant		hello	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Good day."
JasperMerchant		bye	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Goodbye, %NAME. Do come back soon."
JasperMerchant		bye	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Thank you for stopping in, %SIRMADAM."
JasperMerchant		bye	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Good bye."
JasperMerchant		whiskey	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Troll Whiskey is a traditional potion made by the Jasper people, some say magic, some say Qor-badness. But either way, it's illegal, and has been now for some time. They'll hang you for making it, the Duke's people... "
JasperMerchant		whiskey	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Troll Whiskey? Boy oh boy, you're better off not knowing anything at all about Troll Whiskey. Let's just leave it at that."
JasperMerchant		whiskey	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Troll Whiskey is a traditional brew of the people in these hills, and it's some kind of powerful drinking. Boom, like that, blow the top of your head right into the night sky. Not that I would know, you understand, it is illegal. In the days when Jasper was a separate mountain kingdom, the armies of the great Jasper Overlords would drink Troll Whiskey before the would go into battle, and they were undefeatable. Unstoppable. Many say beyond this world, immortals on the battlefield. That's why it became outlawed, when the Jasper people were finally conquered at the Battle of Denthan Crossing, the King then Zarcos II decreed that Troll Whiskey would thereafter be forbidden, to produce or consume."
JasperMerchant		tova	~kZhieu B'hob says, "What a cut-up."
JasperMerchant		barloque	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I was really impressed with Barloque when I was there, oh I guess a couple of years ago now. It is hard to ~Iimagine~I a more dignified city. And grand. Oh, ~II know~I, you would have thought that all the stories about Barloque being the Royal City Of Meridian and all would have painted a pretty complete picture and all for me ~Ibefore~I I even got there, but I'll tell you what, I was surprised all the same. The ocean? Well, Barloque's know for being on the ocean, and if you're like me and never ~Iseen~I something like that then the first thing that you realize is that water ~Istarts~I at the edge of the ocean there and then it just ~Igoes~I on and on like that to the edge of the world or who knows where, but just water as far as a man can see. No stopping it. Whoosh. Just like that. Do you ~Iknow~I what I mean?"
JasperMerchant		barloque	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Barloque is on the other side of Meridian, on the northern coast of the Great Ocean."
JasperMerchant		barloque	~kZhieu B'hob says, "That's the Royal City, and it's kind of like a royal enclave or something, because I'll tell you what, I'd say that just about everybody there is for the Princess and for good King Zarcos V. And when the lines get drawn for the final time about who supports who around here, that's where the next Royal Army will march from. Yes %SIRMADAM, that is where it will all begin."
JasperMerchant		zig	~kZhieu B'hob says, "We are very mindful of the secret police and the Duke's spies up here in the mountains, %NAME. I'll say no more of it, for nothing but trouble comes from that talk."
JasperMerchant		cor NOTH	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Have I told you about the vacation my wife and I took shortly after our wedding? Well, Cor Noth is one of the cities that we visited. I'm here to tell you, talk about the country mouse visiting the city mouse! Cor Noth has some of the nicest folks, but talk? Why those people just love to talk, and about ideas that I just never thought about, let alone discussed! You bet it's a funny city alright, and more friendly than you can imagine! But not at all like Jasper, mostly on account, I'd say, of all the talk. And the things that you'd see in the shops, and such; well we'd never really see those types of things here in Jasper at all unless a stranger came through with them, you know, as personal property or whatnot. But here I am going on and on about Cor Noth when you've probably been there a million times. Have you ever been there yourself, been to Cor Noth?"
JasperMerchant		cor NOTH	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I don't get down to Cor Noth as often as I would like. It is a fine city. Are you from there?"
JasperMerchant		cor NOTH	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I have heard that there is another entrance to the ancient sewer system in Cor Noth, and that by entering there a person could travel ~Icompletely~I underground and come out either here in Jasper, or in Barloque."
JasperMerchant		jasper	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well, I could tell you plenty about Jasper, how much time have you got? Ha ha ha, but really, it's a good town. Full of opportunity, that's what my wife has always said, and where at first I didn't really see so much what she meant, I see it a lot more now. There is plenty of opportunity here, if you can get inside with the locals, and if you have determination. Take me for example, I make a pretty good living, enough to get by, and the goods that I keep in my shop are among the best that you can find anywhere."
JasperMerchant		jasper	~kZhieu B'hob says, "The people of Jasper aren't so hard to understand as some folks let on, just a bit reserved, you know, the silent types. We have sort of a motto here in Jasper, and I think that we do well by it: ~IDon't say nothing at all if you don't have something nice to say~I. Those are words to live by whether here in Jasper, or wherever you take your boots off at the end of the day."
JasperMerchant		jasper	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Before the mines closed down this place was booming. You should have seen Jasper then, I don't think you'd even recognize it. Now it's more like it was in those days, with Jonas setting up his headquarters here and all. I knew that Jasper would once again have its day."
JasperMerchant		tos	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I don't really know much about ~ITos~I, I go down there for business from time to time... not the kind of place I'd go for vacation, I'll say that."
JasperMerchant		wool	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I don't think I've told you about Jasper wool, have I? Well, Jasper produces the finest wool in the land, hands down. There is no better wool anywhere. It's our goats, and the skill of our weavers. I've got some pants here, if you're interested, I can show you exactly what I mean... "
JasperMerchant		goat	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Did I tell you about my pet goat? His name is Aythya, you might see him floating around here sometimes."
JasperMerchant		marion	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I have a cousin ran off to Marion, she married a man down there who raises apples, you know, has an orchard and they picked the apples and sold them to a caravan or something. Both of them into Faren. Well, he up and left one day, took off to find the source of the north wind or something. She says the winters are really hard, but she never came back to Jasper. She seems to like it, I guess, but you know the mountains aren't for everyone. She says at night mostly people sit around and talk, you know, pass the time, and that everybody knows everybody else's business, and that's just how they are. I went there once, but I didn't care much for it, and I don't really see how it is that she's stayed there all these years, seems sort of flat, and quiet, you know, almost eerie in those ways. I guess it's just a matter of getting used to where you're at, like some people spend their whole lives living in pretty much the same place, and others just need to travel. Well, I guess you could say I'm more like the former of the two, I've always been pretty happy right here, even with the mines being gone and the money pretty much trickling in little bits, but what do I have to complain about? Nothing. I don't see anything wrong with this place, with this right here and right now. Do you know what I mean?"
JasperMerchant		marion	~kZhieu B'hob says, "It's mostly a farming town, and we have quite a bit of trade with them. I get down there a couple of times a year."
JasperMerchant		marion	~kZhieu B'hob says, "A sanctuary dedicated to Shal'ille has been set up in Marion, where I understand any in need are welcomed and cared for. Started by some Lady from Barloque, a genuine Lady now, in the royal sense, not just a ~Ilady~I lady %NAME. I have heard that when her husband passed on quite recently, a Lord Aftyn, he left her a considerable fortune and she decided to turn that money into helping people who need it the most! Can you imagine? I hear also that her children, now grown, are quite upset by it too. Poor things. All old enough to take care of themselves too, I hear, but the story goes that they were counting on that money and now they are turned to their own devices! HA! Serves them right!"
JasperMerchant		yevitan	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Don't judge a book by its cover they say, and I guess that applies just so to Yevitan, like a hand might fit right into a glove, or an old shoe, something like that because he is one smart guy. Oh, I don't mean just because he was the King's own Financial Minister specifically, although you know that  in itself is a huge accomplishment, of course, coming from Jasper and all, but I mean he is smart. He's got a lot figured out, you know, sometimes I swear that he can predict the future, that's how smart he is. Oh, I couldn't really give you any examples, you'll have to talk to him yourself and see what you think, because I really couldn't give you any solid examples, but you go and talk to him and I guarantee that you'll see exactly what I mean."
JasperMerchant		yevitan	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Oh, yes, Yevitan... he is the banker here at the Royal Bank. Yevitan paid his dues and bought the bank away from Duke Akardius. He is a very good banker, very trustworthy."
JasperMerchant		yevitan	~kZhieu B'hob says, "A good man to have on your side, Yevitan is. He is always watching out for the people of Jasper. Yevitan... well, I guess you might say he's a patriot. A true patriot, he has so much to offer this land, so many ideas about what our future could be, and now that we have the proper leadership..."
JasperMerchant		duke	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Duke Akardius is not a man to take lightly. That's all I'm going to say on it. Oh, and that he is very good at what he does. You know, it isn't so easy to be a politician, that's what I'd bet. Always making up the truth, you could get real busy having to do that for a living. Sure could."
JasperMerchant		duke	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I am sure that Akardius is as good at weaving lies as his late uncle."
JasperMerchant		duke	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Looks like Kalior's time came... "
JasperMerchant		pietro	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well, Pietro has a little problem with his drinking. You'd think that a grown man would know when to stop...  I mean, I've got nothing whatsoever against drinking, but I don't feel it would be right to send you over there without some sort of preparation, because it can be a little shocking, the state that he gets himself into. All worked up, and you know the Troll Whiskey doesn't help him either."
JasperMerchant		pietro	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Yes, Pietro. Well he's a local man here, runs the bar just down the street there. But I'll tell you frankly %SIRMADAM, you'd only want to go in there if you are ~Ireally~I thirsty."
JasperMerchant		pietro	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well, stupid is as stupid does I always say. I mean, a little control is in order, because that's no way to run a business. And when he drinks, he talks, and he talks about peoples' business that he's got no say in, whatsoever. He better learn to watch his tongue, is all I'm saying, before some gets around to carving it out of his head for him."
JasperMerchant		princess	~kZhieu B'hob says, "You know, my wife and I have been talking about it and we've decided; we cannot wait for the Princess to have her inauguration and just become the Queen. Can you wait? Well, neither of us can, that's for sure. It's my personal opinion that when that happens, when she does get around to accepting the crown and becoming the Queen, there will be a celebration that this kingdom ha never even seen before, let alone imagined. You see, I believe that that's just the sort of thing that we need a bit more of. You know how all the news is about, you know, trolls attacking people or some Yeti monster going all crazy and killing even more, or great big spiders coming from who knows where. Well, I sincerely believe that all of this bad news is on account of no two people having the same good thing to think about. But new royalty? Now that's something that might strike a slightly lighter tone with people, something to look forward to, you know, the kind of thing that makes for wonderful memories between people. Like 'Do you remember exactly where you were when the Princess got crowned Queen?', or, 'Do you remember what we ate on the day we heard the new Queen passed her first Royal Decree?', that kind of thing. Thing is, does she have to get married to take over as the Queen? That's something my wife and I can't seem to agree on, and I don't know honestly which one of us is right... "
JasperMerchant		princess	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Oh, yes, the Princess. Well, she certainly seems to be a ~Icapable~I young woman, hardly more than a girl and with all this responsibility! Can you imagine?"
JasperMerchant		princess	~kZhieu B'hob says, "You might talk with Yevitan about the Princess. He was once... acquainted with the King, and close to the royal family."
JasperMerchant		council	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Council? Oh, the council! Well for a minute there I really didn't know what you were talking about, the council. What do you want to know about the council, what can I tell you? They are the body of our wisest elders, appointed by the king who is no longer in power to help him guide the kingdom. Only problem is that the King isn't there anymore, and they don't seem to realize it yet. Funny, isn't it, and it doesn't sound so wise. For a bunch of smart guys, they seem pretty stupid from where I'm sitting. It's like if your house burns down, but you're tired, do you go to sleep in the ashes? I don't think so, and sure my wife keeps saying that I'm too critical, that I shouldn't be so judgmental about the whole thing, I don't think I am, I think it's admirable what it is they're trying to do for us all, but I don't think that there's one of them with the sense to figure it out. And hey, who pays them anyway? I mean, are they doing it for free? How do they eat?"
JasperMerchant		council	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I don't know much about council politics, except to say that they don't bear much weight in Jasper. No %SIRMADAM, like a fly on plate mail."
JasperMerchant		council	~kZhieu B'hob says, "A bunch of hocus pocus. Who are the council? Do you know? Hey, I'm all for the idea, let's have some guidance. But where's the leadership to go along with it? I'll tell you where, right here in Jasper, and I probably shouldn't be saying anything at all about this, but you should know... the leadership is right here in Jasper, that's where. Yevitan. And I'll say no more. Just Yevitan. He may not be the next King or Queen of Meridian, but he will be the guy who picks them. Why, even now he is putting together... well, never mind that, just know that Yevitan will be at the center of great change in Meridian."
JasperMerchant		wryn's keep	~kZhieu B'hob says, "The Wryn's Keep is the traditional fortress of the old Jasper Overlords, did you know that?"
JasperMerchant		wryn's keep	~kZhieu B'hob says, "It's that big castle on the outskirts of the town here. You can see it from the outside, but you have to be a guest of the guild that has it rented to get inside. Can you imagine anything more insulting to the people of Jasper? I mean, excuse me if you are one of those that are part of that guild, you certainly seem like a nice enough [man, woman], but I can't help getting a little fired up about this. The Wryn's Keep belongs to the people of Jasper, and that's how it should stay. Ours. Not some Frular-Of-Barloque-Businessman Type."
JasperMerchant		wryn's keep	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Nowadays The Wryn's Keep is occupied by strangers, people not from the mountains at all, but they've rented it from Frular of Barloque. That upsets a few of the people here, but not me. I say business is business."
JasperMerchant		quintor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "He's the quiet type, but you know what the say about still rivers running deep. There's a lot more going on there than either you or I would care to imagine. But he's a good businessman, and an excellent craftsman, and what more needs to be said, really? Don't you think that that's enough for one man?"
JasperMerchant		quintor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "A very fine blacksmith, you can take my word on that or you can go and see for yourself. He's just down the street."
JasperMerchant		quintor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "There was a time, when the mines were still in operation, that Quintor had such a lovely young wife, a local girl. Well, saddest thing, but when the mines closed, I guess his young wife just figured that maybe she would clear out of here with the rest of them, she broke her vows and packed it up with on of the mining company officers and she was gone. Now Quintor, he went into such a rage, such a rage... I was only a child at the time, but I'll never forget it."
JasperMerchant		widow qesino	~kZhieu B'hob says, "I knew old man Qesino pretty well, before he disappeared. Not to speak poorly of the dead, but he was an ornery, unpleasant man. Always thought someone was trying to cheat him out of something. Didn't really make any attempt to temper himself, you know, get along with people. Even in Jasper you need a few niceties... makes things so much easier, you know what I mean?"
JasperMerchant		widow qesino	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Tragic, just tragic. Her husband disappearing and all."
JasperMerchant		widow qesino	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well, perhaps her husband wasn't the easiest man to get along with, I mean, that was just kind of accepted around here, and Faren knows I didn't have to live with the man... but I have to say that it was odd, you know, at the funeral... I ~Iwatched~I her at that funeral, not to be rude or anything, but I was ~Iconcerned~I at the time... and I swear to you, she didn't shed a single tear. Now even for the Jasper people, who are never very outward with their emotions, I have to say that it was a ~Ibit~I odd... "
JasperMerchant		afiera d'xor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "He is absolutely the oldest and wisest man in Jasper, and he is our treasure. Like the crown of Jasper, I suppose, or the secret. Like when you want to keep a secret so badly, I mean so  badly as though it were the most important thing in the world that you keep a secret but you find your lips moving all on their own trying to tell the secret out loud to anyone at all. and you have to fight just to keep the secret down every minute? That kind of secret? Well, that's what he is, a secret like that only better, because he's for the whole town, everyone in the town. He knows so much about art and about music. I think he knows a lot about magic too, because I think that some people come to him to learn spells, but I don't know that for sure. I know that he belongs to this place though, he knows those mountains like the back of his own hand. He's spent his life up here in the mountains wandering around, mostly by himself. Afiera D'xor knows things that we can't even begin to understand."
JasperMerchant		afiera d'xor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "He is an old and venerable part of our community."
JasperMerchant		afiera d'xor	~kZhieu B'hob says, "He has a place here in town, and spends most of his time working there now, although as you probably already know he spent his life in solitude in these mountains, out with the beasts, and the gods, do you know what I mean? He is alone, and that's what he's chosen. To dedicate his life to art, and to Jala... er, I mean Faren, you know, and all the other gods too, because you can't really take just one and holds those beliefs sacred above all others, you need to study how all of their ways are necessary. He taught me that, Afiera D'xor did."
JasperMerchant		yes	~kZhieu B'hob says, "Well then you know all about it then."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "They say that the King has been gone from his throne these many years, and that many calamities have befallen the land because of this. What nonsense! This world follows its' own indescribable path, and nothing may alter that. Kings and Queens are the personification of our vanity, no more."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Old Alzahakar is a wise man. A great magician, and a learned man of many, many books. Perhaps he can help you find a way into your own secret reserves. There is potential that resides within, which even now is waiting for the winter surrounding you to retreat."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Jala is not dead unless she is forgotten completely. She is not dead as long as we keep her alive."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "The treefolk have an old saying for those that speak the tongue. They say "Today is the forest fire, and tomorrow the ashes." They lived only in nightmares, and visions. So there will be a time when all of this passes too, and of our dreams now will then replace this dream, and on, and on."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Be wary in choosing your enemies when the chances to pick them for yourself are afforded. If the choice is never there, then make sure whatever enemies you have don't forget you until they are dead."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have never had any money, nor any interest in the stuff. There are too many I know that follow money above all else, convinced that just to have a little more will truly save them, once and for all... "
JasperElder			~k Afiera D'xor says, "It is often better to avoid trouble as it approaches. Step around it, let it pass. That is the wisdom of an old man, but one who continues to live and to get older."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "You could devote your life to studying the tokens. Many have. You could also devote your life to chasing your own tail, so to speak. It is a mistake to believe that we can understand something just through learned observation, without delving into the pattern behind it, the grand pattern. Imagination. Meaning."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "It isn't as though we have a choice about art, or music. It is just as much a part of our existence as speaking and listening are."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "You have come a long way to be here, I can see that."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "You can go wherever you wish by fighting your way in, or if you are clever enough you can get to the same places by avoiding violence and stepping around trouble. There are innumerable ways to achieve exactly what you want in this world, my friend."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Don't sweat over the little things... inconveniences, petty slights. There is real tragedy and heartache enough to go around."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "I believe that our conversation is over for now. Come and see me another time."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "People are basically stupid."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Go out there and fight for your living, if that's what you must do. It's easier than thinking, right?"
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "It is not enough to create, we must create with risks. From great conflicts come the most powerful surges of creativity, and people aren't happy unless they're miserable. Do you follow me?"
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Enjoy yourself."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Be who you want to be. This, all of this, is just a game. Just a game. It's as important as you want it to be."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "There is no right and wrong among the gods. All are equal, all are necessary. Honor their purpose, all."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Do you know that the orc have a culture that predates our own by a thousand years? I have seen some of the artistic achievements of their people, and count myself fortunate for the insight. For all the outward signs of hostility and apparent ignorance to our own realities, the orcish tribes have a cultural sophistication that we same incapable of comprehending,"
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Blessed be Shal'ille, who is gentle and compassionate."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "All hail Jala, our lady of art, of song, and of truth."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Honor Faren, who finds a pattern in the chaos of this world."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Welcome Riija, who honors us with remembrance and vision."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Behold Mighty Kraanan, admirable in his strength and his furious action."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Praise to Qor, who seeks undoing."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Who are you?"
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "What do you seek?"
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "History does not repeat itself, historians tend to repeat each other."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "The music of the earth is a source of magic in and of itself."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "There are secrets beyond the ocean, beyond the mountains, beyond our settlement towns and cities certainly. Secrets that uncover themselves in time, and time."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "You came here to see an old man, and now you have seen me. Why don't you make yourself comfortable there while I work. I will tell you what I can."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "The so-called tokens are relics from a bygone era, from an intelligence that passed over this land so many generations before we came here to dream that nothing remains of them but souvenirs, trinkets beyond our imaginations."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Did you know that the trolls have a heritage all of their own, a history that is both rich and exclusive of ours as our history is exclusive of them?"
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Please leave me now. I must return to my carving."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have nothing else to share with you now."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "I must get back to my work now."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "What do you understand?"
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Find your place and go there. Take your time, and think about what is happening in your life. It is really quite simple."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "There are no easy answers."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Life is in the process of happening all around you, right? What are you waiting for?"
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Stay. Rest. We shall talk by and by."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Look around and you'll find your own way. You have time, if you wish to."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "The dead rise in Tos because we will it so, you see, most of our perceived enemies are thus... inventions, fancies of the collective imagination."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "You can see yourself out."
JasperElder		hello	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Come in, %NAME."
JasperElder		hello	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yes? Who is it? Step closer so that I might see you."
JasperElder		hello	~kAfiera D'xor doesn't seem to have noticed that you are even here.
JasperElder		bye	~kAfiera D'xor says, "You must come back and see me soon."
JasperElder		bye	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yes, goodbye."
JasperElder		bye	~kAfiera D'xor seems to have forgotten that you are here at all.
JasperElder		barloque	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I lead a simple life here, with my people and my art."
JasperElder		barloque	~kAfiera D'xor says, "A beautiful city, though I haven't been there for some years."
JasperElder		barloque	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have no use for the place."
JasperElder		cor NOTH	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Lovely place, if I remember correctly."
JasperElder		cor NOTH	~kAfiera D'xor says, "As far as a construct of this civilization goes, it's not a bad one."
JasperElder		cor NOTH	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Is that where you've come from?"
JasperElder		jasper	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Here you have it."
JasperElder		jasper	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Look around for yourself."
JasperElder		jasper	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Well, what do you think? Go out there and look around, you are capable of coming to your own conclusions."
JasperElder		marion	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have not been to Marion in a very long time."
JasperElder		marion	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Tell me, what is it like these days, Marion?"
JasperElder		marion	~kAfiera D'xor seems to be thinking of something else.
JasperElder		tos	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yes, Tos."
JasperElder		tos	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Tos? I'm afraid I don't know very much about the city itself."
JasperElder		tos	~kAfiera D'xor says, "The very center of nonsense in this place."
JasperElder		duke	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Those who wish to follow such a pretender both strengthen his resolve to pursue the crown and validate his claim to it."
JasperElder		duke	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Politicians come and then pass as the seasons pass. Who is the Duke but a man among his fellow citizens?"
JasperElder		duke	~kAfiera D'xor says, "He makes a fine politician, but would he truly make a good king?"
JasperElder		princess	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Ho hum."
JasperElder		princess	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yes, I spoke with her once, a very long time ago. I don't doubt that she has honorable intentions, but I don't think that she has the will for the undertaking of leadership."
JasperElder		princess	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Take your questions to her then."
JasperElder		jonas	~kAfiera D'xor says, "A good man at heart, if a little too determined, but he would make a sound ruler, if he can just get past his need for vengeance that is."
JasperElder		jonas	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Have you two been introduced?"
JasperElder		jonas	~kAfiera D'xor says, "He's probably in the bar talking grand strategy, go find him and ask."
JasperElder		council	~kAfiera D'xor says, "A bunch of pretty smart people. But so are goat thieves, bartenders, and street urchins."
JasperElder		lighting	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Conjuring an attack of lightning is a power that I learned from the many years that I spent among the tree folk. I am not adverse to passing it on to those with a capacity to understand, and to utilize the power for what it is."
JasperElder		lighting	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I don't have time for this now."
JasperElder		dement	~kAfiera D'xor says, "In truth there is but one pool of magic, which is drawn upon from every side, simple. Once you understand that, it is not overly difficult to disrupt those connections by simply disrupting that pool. Splash around a bit... "
JasperElder		dement	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Come back another time and we shall talk. I cannot help you now."
JasperElder		orc	~kAfiera D'xor says, "An ancient and venerable civilization, completely misunderstood by our limited end/means sensibilities. But they have also perpetuated these myths. I fear we shall never find the truth, which is not that the orcs are bad and we are good, or right, but that we are scared to death that our world will become something new tomorrow. Even though it must."
JasperElder		orc	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Leave me now."
JasperElder		centipede	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Simple creatures."
JasperElder		centipede	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Take some responsibility and go find out for yourself."
JasperElder		troll	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Do you know anyone who has ever spoken with a troll? It isn't likely. Not that they are what we would really consider to be interesting conversationalists, sitting here, the two of us. They aren't, by our standards, particularly quick, or keen. The point is that we don't even try, even those that purport to identify with Shal'ille and the ways of healing are all too ready to fight rather then trying to understand. We don't want to hear their answers, so we don't even bother to speak to them at all."
JasperElder		troll	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I don't have anything to say to you at all."
JasperElder		rat	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Rats are in conflict with us humans essentially because we are both scavengers, competing for the same limited piles of garbage and waste."
JasperElder		rat	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Rat?"
JasperElder		spider	~kAfiera D'xor says, "The spiders have their own purpose. Can you really blame them for the appearance of hostility when to them you look like a walking meat pie? They are great hunters."
JasperElder		spider	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I cannot talk any more now. Please leave me."
JasperElder		yeti	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I believe that the yeti is the both guardian and messenger. But what message? They are solitary creatures."
JasperElder		yeti	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Yeti? Forgive me, but my concentration is elsewhere. You must leave now."
JasperElder		ant	~kAfiera D'xor says, "A gentle creature if avoided completely."
JasperElder		ant	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Goodbye. Come back another time."
JasperElder		tree folk	~kAfiera D'xor says, "The tree folk have been upon this land for many millenium, and have discovered ways to maintain peace and to pass existence by their own terms."
JasperElder		tree folk	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I will not speak with you any further today, I must return to my work."
JasperElder		jala	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Jala's true secret has yet to unfold. I have spent my life in thought and meditation over the fate of the Jala, and the fates of art and of music... I can tell you with confidence that Jala is not dead. I cannot pretend to know where she is, for she is the most mysterious and elusive of our deities... but I can tell you that she has shown me that will return when the time is right."
JasperElder		jala	~kAfiera D'xor says, "If you are going to study the ways of the earth along the path of a god, then you must look carefully at all of the gods, for all are equally necessary to complete the design. Do not forget Jala, whom many say is dead. How can art be dead? Music? Do not believe half of this talk. Look around, tell me what's true."
JasperElder		jala	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I am tired now. Please go."
JasperElder		faren	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Faren is the closest deity to the source of all power, and he is on the rise. I know this. Beneath all lies chaos, and beneath chaos, Faren. That is all that I will say."
JasperElder		faren	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have spent a large portion of my life studying the ways of this world, of the natural orders, and have learned some small and overall meaningless tricks to help me survive. Many attribute the mastery of these tricks to Faren, and Faren magic, but I know better, do you understand? There is but one magic. Only one, from which all sources are drawn."
JasperElder		faren	~kAfiera D'xor says, "You must leave now. Our conversation is over for today."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "I have a few small apartments upstairs, which will occasionally come up for rent. There are no vacancies now, but check with me later if you are interested."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "I have heard from travelers of an ancient building out in the forest that was a dwarven hall. This makes me very curious."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "If you are traveling from city to town, I believe you will find that people may have errands for you to deliver to their remote destinations! Oh, the countryside is hardly safe for an unarmed messenger!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "It is a strange and bountiful land, noble one. Many of the exotic items that you come across in your wanderings will have a market when you reach the towns, so preserve what you can. There are some items that I am always looking for, and will draw a fine price in gold."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Many of the things in my shop must come across the southern passes in the Cragged Mountains. It is a perilous journey, Tabu, for these passes are the home of the most fearsome trolls. And for the past few years now I hear reports of orcs and mutated ants there as well. It's no wonder our import prices rise!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Cor Noth is the center of trade and other activities of culture in this land, noble one. You must take the time to enjoy this fine city while you are here. I am certain you will find it to your liking!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "I have an extensive collection of magical reagents here, many of them quite rare. I offer the best prices for quality goods as well, my friend, so see me before you go to Tos, Barloque or Marion. We can reach an agreement, jhonee tabu, because we are old friends."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "My friends come from every part of this world to visit me and enjoy the hospitality, Tabu. I am blessed by their presence, by the generosity of the gods, and by the many, many stories of my guests!! Oh, I hear stories from every part of the kingdom."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Perhaps you would be able to better get along with those that you have dealings with, siidhika, if you would pay closer attention to what the other party wants! Every transaction, every conversation has two sides, but how would I expect a wagzidi herak to understand that!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "You have definitely come to the right place for your magical reagent requirements!! Although I may not carry everything that you need, but what I have is the best quality! Just between the two of us, I feel quite sorry for those customers of mine that must do business with Joguer."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Oh, that Rook! What a sad friend that I have in that man Rook. He hides from his lost love as though it were a forgotten love, yes? Oh yes, he is in love, but his love is for the Princess and may never be realized. Ah, so tragic and so complicated!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "And what has happened to the merchant Qesino of Jasper? Yes, an innkeeper from Jasper, perhaps you knew him for he was a prosperous man. Generous? No! Prosperous? Yes! But now he has gone missing, and with a large amount of ~Igold~I."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Yes, and have you been to see the madman in Marion? Ah Tabu, what ravings! What diwesafi! What kagdur! Many years ago he walked the land and I knew him then, and I believe that he is a prophet. Yes, truly!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "My dear friend Herbutte has a very fine shop in Barloque. And what a gentleman he is, of the most regal bearing!! And his shop also is full of beautiful things, perhaps if I do not have what you need he will. Be sure to tell him that I sent you!!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Ah, prattlemouth! How you remind me of the fool of Tos, Rycksher. Always talk . Gossip and talking, and the business of everyone else. Ha, ha  ha ha!! Well you won't get any gossip in my shop!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Bung dabba!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Think of my shop as though it were your own, noble one. As your own."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Relax, and enjoy my hospitality, my dear friend. Although it is modest I offer you every comfort that I possess."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Look around, Tabu, take all of my time that you wish to take. When you are in my shop you may leave time and trouble together at the door, where they may be occupied with each other while you are my guest."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Providence has truly blessed me today with your presence, Tabu. I am blessed every way."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Yes, beautiful things. Exotic, beautiful things."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "I am sure, noble one, that I must have something here that you have been living without for much too long."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "What happiness that you are here today, Tabu. I have just received merchandise that I am sure you will appreciate."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "It is my tremendous fortune to have you here to visit, Tabu. May I show you anything in particular? Or have you come today to sell?"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Please, you are my guest. Be comfortable and enjoy the modest jewel that is my shop."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Binghi ghaloob, my friend, binghi ghaloob."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "How happy I am to see you, noble one."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "I am your humble servant, Tabu, honored to count you among my friends. Please be kind enough to pass the time with me."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "What is that stench? Oh, it's you, my friend! I am so sorry, so sorry, I would have completely overlooked you in all of your insignificance if it were not for that terrible smell you exude!! Ha, ha ha ha ha! Oh, siidhika bagab, I am so sorry but you are repulsive, like fried liver and stink grass! Ha, ha ha ha ha!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Be careful siidhika, that you do not drop some of your fleas on my carpeting and tapestry work, I will have to get a Kraanan mender in to de-louse the shop. Ha, ha ha ha ha!! No offense, ghazzabu, but indeed you are a pathetic specimen, ha, ha ha ha ha! What can I do for you? I am afraid that I do not sell soap or ghum dikka!!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Do you continue to befoul my modest and humble shop, beetle stain? Ah, that is truly the trouble with leaving the door open, siidhika, one never knows what offending debris may waft in with the next breeze! Ha, ha ha ha ha!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Ah, be sure to scrape off your feet before coming in to my shop next time, dung boy! This is a shop where nice people wish to pass time, not the barnyard you frequent, billy goat! Haga dhami zeet, sidhika."
CornothGrocer		hello	~kSolomon says, "Solomon is at your service, noble one. Ghiza Tabu, haatik."
CornothGrocer		hello	~kSolomon says, "Come in, Tabu, come in. It has been so long since you came to see us!"
CornothGrocer		hello	~kSolomon says, "Yes? Exactly what does siidhika precisely want, exactly?"
CornothGrocer		bye	~kSolomon says, "Keep the fair wind at your heels, my friend. I am missing you already."
CornothGrocer		bye	~kSolomon says, "Blessings upon you. I am counting the days until you come back to see us."
CornothGrocer		bye	~kSolomon says, "Avoid the wrath of your own ignorance, my friend. Ha, ha ha ha ha! Aebu sikal gah tamaal! Good bye, siidhika! Baszoo!!"
CornothGrocer		lady aftyn	~kSolomon says, "Yes, Tabu, the very definition of a Lady. So generous and kind, Lady Aftyn, that she no has opened a Sanctuary in Marion where she cares for the sick and the unfortunate! And with her own money! Yes, Tabu, her children are most upset by her actions since the death of her husband, a very wealth Lord that I knew so very well, may the gods smile at his soul... The children are still in Barloque, such scandal, making many noises about their mother squandering their inheritance on her charitable work and on the workings of Shal'ille! Goodness me, Tabu, goodness me."
CornothGrocer		barloque	~kSolomon says, "When you are in Barloque, all of the best is available! And I might know, as they all come to see Solomon for their most exquisite fancies! Ha, ha ha ha ha!! When you are in Barloque, Tabu, see the shop of my very dear friend Herbutte! A very refined gentleman! Be sure to give him my kindest regards."
CornothGrocer		barloque	~kSolomon says, "It is the city of Meridians' old Kings, and very, very wealthy! Yes, I travel there often for my business and know the people well, and I tell you, noble one, that there is unimaginable wealth in Barloque. And such refined taste! The best business."
CornothGrocer		barloque	~kSolomon says, "Well, they stop indigents and farm animals at the front gate of Barloque, so either way you will have no luck, 'O No-Mannered One'. Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		cor NOTH	~kSolomon says, "You should consider this your second home, Tabu. Come back and see us often."
CornothGrocer		cor NOTH	~kSolomon says, "I call this my home that is away from my home, for although my homeland is so very far away, and nothing will replace my homeland in my heart, Cor Noth is the most precious and free jewel in all of Meridian."
CornothGrocer		cor NOTH	~kSolomon says, "How did you get past the front gate? All these taxes I pay, I really must speak with the constable. Ha, ha ha ha ha!! No, really I don't believe that. This is a free city, where everyone is afforded free access and freedom to speak. Even blockheads, and hamsters such as yourself!! Ha. ha ha ha ha!"
CornothGrocer		jasper	~kSolomon says, "Did you know that Jasper was once a separate kingdom, and stayed in rebellion long after the King in Meridian declared that they must surrender? That will tell you something about Jasper. A very terrible war followed. The fortress of the old Jasper Warlords, Wryn's Keep, stands to this day as testament. The people of Jasper, I believe, still want their independence to this time! There are many secrets in Jasper, even today. Especially today."
CornothGrocer		jasper	~kSolomon says, "Although the mines in Jasper have run dry and the miners moved away, there are still a considerable number of gems that come out of the western Cragged Mountains, and Jasper in particular. Of course with the rebellion centered there  are many more means to acquire wealth now."
CornothGrocer		jasper	~kSolomon says, "I hear that Jasper is the center of the unrest that threatens to send the land into chaos."
CornothGrocer		marion	~kSolomon says, "Marion is so very stable, and the people so funny in their ways!! But the forests surrounding Marion are deep, and hold many secrets! I have seen some incredible things that have been brought out of these forests. I believe that the discovery of the Vale of Sorrow is just the beginning of incredible things that future explorers might find! Imagine the trade then, Tabu, the commercial opportunities!!"
CornothGrocer		marion	~kSolomon says, "A simple town of simple folk. Farmers! The very stones of the earth! An honest town, my friend. We must all thank the farmer and the farm!!"
CornothGrocer		marion	~kSolomon says, "You will be in good company there, siidhika, amongst the swine, Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		tos	~kSolomon says, "Tos is the financial center of Meridian. Many business people are loathe to say that aloud, but I will tell you that it is true."
CornothGrocer		tos	~kSolomon says, "The memory of Kalior shall forever stay with Tos. It was he who made it the grand city that it is. I wonder if it shall all fall into decay?"
CornothGrocer		tos	~kSolomon says, "Is this where you have come from, little dried fish person, have you come from Tos? Well it is a short trip back, and I think that you should make it soon. You should go home and study hard before you come back out among the rest of us, siidhaki."
CornothGrocer		duke	~kSolomon says, "A sad state of affairs. I am still reeling from the news of our Duke's death. I do hope that the taxes are not further increased."
CornothGrocer		princess	~kSolomon says, "With the fall of the Duke and the maturing of our Princess, Kateriina shall soon have the crown on her head."
CornothGrocer		duke princess	~kSolomon says, "Aebu sikal gah tamaal!"
CornothGrocer		council	~kSolomon says, "They are a very wise number of men, very wise indeed. And entrusted to make decisions over all the land! Sometimes, though, I think that they could use the advice of a woman... "
CornothGrocer		council	~kSolomon says, "A group of very fine gentleman, Tabu, very fine! Entrusted by the King, no less! And always willing to teach and share wisdom, I hear."
CornothGrocer		council	~kSolomon says, "Bah!! What do you know of the council, siidhika?"
CornothGrocer		herbutte	~kSolomon says, "I believe that he is related to royalty! Yes, I think that it is true!!"
CornothGrocer		herbutte	~kSolomon says, "A very fine gentleman, and also... my friend! Herbutte has a shop full of beautiful things in Barloque."
CornothGrocer		herbutte	~kSolomon says, "I wonder would such a gentleman as Herbutte have you in his shop? No, I do not think so. I am too tolerant in so many ways!"
CornothGrocer		madelia	~kSolomon says, "Yes, she is a very desirable sort, a terrible heartbreaker! Poor jhonee!! She scorned Frisconar, and rightfully so, for he if dumma, unhealthy. Now I hear she has a great love affair with Frular the Guildmaster! But noble one, you did not hear that from me, for he is a married man! Oh dear, such scandal! Baszoo!!"
CornothGrocer		madelia	~kSolomon says, "She is in Barloque, and what an accomplished dressmaker. She makes all of the clothing for the royalty, and it is said that she has great influence!! Yes, great influence!! It is just as well that she spurned the love of that dinki padarapoomy Frisconar!"
CornothGrocer		rycksher	~kSolomon says, "I wonder what he'll do now."
CornothGrocer		rycksher	~kSolomon says, "Oh, he is a terrible gossip! Always ready to speak on any other person! I frown upon gossip."
CornothGrocer		rycksher	~kSolomon says, "Go find him in the Duke's castle, siidhika, and chat with him! And when you are there, tell him to come around my shop so I can box his ears for him!!"
CornothGrocer		joguer	~kSolomon says, "I would not even bother to make comment on this simple merchant. Like the hagzjaffe, with big teeth that never bites. Chat  chat , but the quality of his merchandise? Below standard."
CornothGrocer		frisconar	~kSolomon says, "Always sick, that man, just as his business is! Unhealthy. He lives with a broken heart from Madelia, not other ailment.! Haga dhami zeet!! Baszoo!!"
CornothGrocer		morrigan	~kSolomon says, "That ghazzabu does not know a dragon scale from an orc tooth! Ha, ha ha ha ha!! One of my customers sold him three dozen edible mushrooms at great profit, for Morrigan thought that he was buying purple mushrooms!! Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		joguer	~kSolomon says, "That is good, siidhika, take your business to that cretin!! Bah!! You will get exactly what you seek! Baszoo!!"
CornothGrocer		hagzjaffe	~kSolomon says, "From my homeland, this is a great beast with terrible teeth and a terrible roar that flees from sudden movements or the smallest noises!"
CornothGrocer		ran er'hoth	~kSolomon says, "Many laugh at that man, but he is a prophet, and has visions and premonitions that tell many tales of our tomorrows. Baszoo!!"
CornothGrocer		ran er'hoth	~kSolomon says, "Ran er'Hoth is without knowing, as the wind is without knowing. Baszoo!!"
CornothGrocer		rook	~kSolomon says, "Ah yes, Rook indeed! The sad tale of Rook is a sad tale of impossible love! We cannot know if it is a love of duty or of the woman herself, but his love for the Princess came to complicate his duty to her as the Major of the Royal Guards, and he was forced to leave the court! Dueling for her honor! Tragic, eh? Now he spends his days taking students at the weapon school and waiting for a message from her that it is time to return to her side. Just waiting and waiting, for a message that may never arrive. But he is a hard man and will wait until he dies. Baszoo."
CornothGrocer		rook	~kSolomon says, "Rook, yes Rook? Ahhh, Rook! Yes Rook is a great weapon master, who once served as the Major of the Royal Guards before retiring to this fine city and opening the weapon school. He is a stern man, but he is understanding, and we in Cor Noth are honored to have him here. They say that in his years at court he was a fierce duelist when his temper flared, but he is not this way anymore. Baszoo."
CornothGrocer		rook	~kSolomon says, "What do you ask me of Rook for, silly siidhika? Don't get any ideas, you don't need to challenge Rook to impress us! We are already impressed with your dim wits, dinki padarapoomy. Baszoo."
CornothGrocer		tabu	~kSolomon says, "Tabu is a word from my people meaning 'treasured and well-disposed friend'."
CornothGrocer		siidhika	~kSolomon says, "Siidhika is a word from my home, very far away, which means 'a dimwit possessing only the outlook of a vacant manure heap'. Ha, ha ha ha ha!"
CornothGrocer		jhonee	~kSolomon says, "That is from my native tongue of whagzii. Jhonee means, approximately, little squirrel."
CornothGrocer		ghum dikka	~kSolomon says, "Ah, yes, ghum dikka! Well that is a thing from my far home that we use to clean the baby after he has eaten too much kaab farlu."
CornothGrocer		kaab farlu	~kSolomon says, "Kaab farlu? Ah, Tabu, a delicious mixture of beans and fermented lettuce! It is very delicious, but a dish one must always remember to never feed the baby. That is very bad."
CornothGrocer		ghazzabu	~kSolomon says, "Yes, that ghazzabu is a large and stupid animal that we hunt in my homeland with large stones, which we drop upon their heads from the greatest height imaginable. Splat!! Everywhere brains. But for all those brains the stupid ghazzabu still cannot think like a clever animal!! Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		wagzidi herak	~kSolomon says, "This is the man, in my home country, who must stand in the market and collect spare sepkas from the farmers and their families. Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		sepkas	~kSolomon says, "The sepkas? You don't know what the sepkas are? Ha, ha ha ha, you are so funny!!"
CornothGrocer		bagab	~kSolomon says, "Bagab? Ha, ha ha ha ha, why a bagab is a person who hasn't the sense to wear shoes! Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		haga dhami zeet	~kSolomon says, "Ah, those are words from my native tongue that mean 'a man with water running through the spaces in his head'. Funny, yes? Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		ghiza	~kSolomon says, "This means morning of large breakfast, and is a great compliment in whagzii."
CornothGrocer		haatik	~kSolomon says, "This means simply 'it is my pleasure'."
CornothGrocer		whagzii	~kSolomon says, "That is the native tongue of my homeland, many  miles from here."
CornothGrocer		aebu sikal gah tamaal	~kSolomon says, "This is a whagzii phrase that we say to only the stupidest people which means 'go and put your head into the oatmeal pot'. Yes, only the stupidest people!! Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		baszoo	~kSolomon says, "Baszoo means only that there is nothing more that we can say on the subject, that it is now in the hands of time and in the hands of the gods."
CornothGrocer		dinki padarapoo my	~kSolomon says, "Ha, ha ha ha ha!! Dinki padarapoomy is a word from the Maldive language which means 'carpenter who has nailed his own feet to the doorjamb'. Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		diweafi	~kSolomon says, "Yes, Tabu, diwesafi means... how do you say it? Comprehension. Like a divine comprehension. Like that, but a little different too."
CornothGrocer		kagdur	~kSolomon says, "Kagdur is a word from the whagzii which means something like 'absurd clarity of vision', or something like that. Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		binghi ghaloob	~kSolomon says, "Binghi ghaloob? Binghi ghaloob does not precisely translate to your language. The meaning of binghi ghaloob is quite complicated."
CornothGrocer		tabu 	~kSolomon says, "Why do you ask me questions about these words? I don't trust you with understanding anything, siidhika, and especially not the words of an ancient and venerable tongue such as whagzii. But do not despair, for no good can come of it! It is not your fault that you were born a buffalo among men. Ha, ha ha ha ha!!"
CornothGrocer		bung	~kSolomon says, "What would you like it to mean, my friend?"
CornothGrocer		binghi ghaloob	~kSolomon says, "Binghi ghaloob means 'you have terrible manners like a donkey with gas, and I hope you rot in your own bile'. Ha, ha ha ha ha!!!"
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "The orcish scimitar is a ungainly weapon, heavy and off balance. Certainly not the weapon for a officer, though it is quite fearsome in the hands of those practiced in the skill. There are those around that would be able to teach a warrior those skills. Not myself, mind you."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Look straight into the eyes of your enemy, as your battle approaches and when battle is engaged. Do not shift your gaze to their hands, their sword, or any distraction that they might encourage. The battle will be won or lost through their eyes."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "The swordsman rules the day. Or swordswoman, for many of the finest warriors in this land are female, as I should know, for they all pass through these doors seeking the advice of the ~Imaster~I."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "I am to understand that there is a great teacher on the faraway land at Ko'catan who teaches the bow. A fantastic weapon for the hunting, but forsooth I cannot say that a warrior would use it with honor in the field of battle."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "If thou might wish to dedicate thyself to the scimitar, then I have heard that there is a man in Jasper that might be persuaded to help thee with that. I have heard that there is a teacher there who has great skills at the orcish weapon."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "'Tis a swordsman that thou fancies thyself? Mayhap I could show thee some guidance in your discipline, if thou art practiced enough and ready to progress."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Dost thou work then with the battle axe, to master its finer points? I too have dedicated my life to the combative skills and their perfection, and now earn my fortunes by teaching what I can. When thou art ready to learn more skills, perhaps I will help thee for a price."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "If thou art following the path of the archer, then thou hast come to the wrong place, for I know nothing of that weapon except that those that fight by bow do so without honor. If thou art following the path of the archer, then get thee gone to the company of rogues and ambushers, for that is who would use such a weapon."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Dost thou use the mace as thy weapon of preference? 'Tis an honorable weapon, and deadly in the hands of one versed in its mastery."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Of the traditional weapons, I would take the long sword above all others. It is the mainstay of the King's Army, and as such I have spent the best of my life dedicated to the perfection of its art."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "The ways of magic are the ways of priests, the weak, the blind. Forsooth the ways of magic are the ways of those without the mettle to fight with honor, and distinction."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "For the enterprising traveler, there are often messages that must be carried back and forth between parties across the land. Thou will'st certainly gain favor and often profit by playing the envoy."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "The short sword is an honorable weapon, the weapon of the ancient gladiators of Tos. It is no match for the long sword in its reach, but it is deadly close-in."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "There will be trouble soon between the factions. Fighting trouble."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "If you wish to improve your skills as a warrior, you must fight against opponents that are worthy, nay, even beyond your abilities."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "You will not advance your abilities if you are not willing to take risks. If you want to grow stronger, you must face great danger, and be willing to take wounds."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Kateriina needs to take the throne now. All things point to it. She is of age, Kalior is no more, and that fledgling politician, Akardius, is not fit to rule."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Thou hast come seeking the finest master swordsman to ever grace this land, and thou stands now before him. What dost thou humbly ask?"
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "There are some warriors that seek solace in the mighty Kraanan. They have developed spells, potions and wands in his powerful name... I feel certain that Kraanan himself is angered at these weaklings, and at their inability to wield a blade. A warrior hasn't time to pray in battle."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Leave me."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "I haven't time for you. Leave this place."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Our conversation is over. Leave me now."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook mumbles, Impudent upstart, power is so important to him now that he is determined to take others down with him."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "If thou will dedicate thyself with equal ardor to the combative arts as thou dedicates thyself to meaningless prattle, you will surely be a giant."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook pointedly ignores you.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "The future of this land is as a map is, where the mileposts will instead be swords. It is a map where the piled corpses of the enemies of the crown will lie as thick road lines to mark the passage of the valiant forces of the Princess Kateriina."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "I am loyal to none save the crown and to the lineage of the Zarcos line, a family of most royal bearing. Their direct bloodline has ruled this fair land for two centuries and half another, a bloodline that now sustains in the rightful heiress Kateriina. No others will ever challenge this right by sword as long as I stand."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "I have killed twenty-four men in duels alone. Do you think you live by honor? By chivalry? It is up to you how you want to live, and how you die. If you live with dignity and honor then death is of no consequence."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "King Zarcos lives, but is in hiding somewhere in Barloque. The time is right for him to return."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "On what side dost thou stand, friend? Barloque or Tos? If thou com'st from the Duke's camp, why then state thy business and we shall see to it now. But if thou dost side with the Princess, why then thou art most welcome, and consider my house as your own."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "If a man is not afraid to die, then it is of no avail to threaten him."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "The ultimate honor for a warrior is to pick the time and the place of his own death."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Training, training, training. That is the way behind the greatest warriors, every one."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "The shield is a useful tool, and if thou will fight with one, choose yours carefully."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "The great yetis of the ice caves to the west are a challenge even to fighters of the most developed ability."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "The orcs are powerful swordsmen, though certainly lacking in the subtly that come with study. But do not underestimate them. You may end up paying for that mistake with your life."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Yes, I am the greatest swordsman who has ever lived. The greatest."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Pick your battles carefully. You will retain your enemies forever, for the most powerful of them will never forgive, or forget."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "You must never back down from ~Iany~I fight, against ~Iany~I foe. Never concede, nor surrender an inch of ground. Even if you are killed, it will be with your pride."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Keep your wits sharp, and your strategy two steps before the strategy of your foe. Strategy and skill will prevail over even the most powerful enemy who fights with skill alone."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "You stand before a master. Bow."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Gather then ten most gifted sword fighters in the land, and send them at me in one fell swoop. I will deliver to thee ten bodies, ten headless peasants, a would be without a scratch."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Get thee gone. I am weary from the burden of your company, and my patience grows thin."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "I have no more time to waste with your like. Begone."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Thou dost not want to anger me, be certain of that. Go, before you err beyond mine temper, knave."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Go back to your Duke and tell him to keep his servants about his own house, where they won't get hurt. If you stay here I cannot promise your safety, slave. Get thee along to thy mommy."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "I live by the code of honor and that of the blade. There is no question that cannot be resolved within these sacred laws."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook is so clearly a little man with an over-active ego.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook seems easily offended.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook is a man with a legendary temper, with the reputation as the greatest duelist of the age.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook has the mannerisms of a well-groomed military officer, although beneath his impeccable manners lies the temper of a gut-shot troll.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "What can I do for you today?"
CorNothSergeant			~kRook taps a little rhythmic patter out with his fingers against the back of his left hand.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook eyes you coolly. 
CorNothSergeant			~kRook stands very, very straight and watches your every movement.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook is possessed with a sense of grace and agility that is evident immediately to any in his presence.
CorNothSergeant			~kStanding before this little man it isn't hard to see that his reputation as the deadliest swordsman alive is believable. His every move is careful, smooth.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook's eyes become narrow slits, as he watches you with calculated venom.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook nods his head slowly, watching you move about the room.
CorNothSergeant			~kRook is fuming mad.
CorNothSergeant		hello	~kRook says, "Come in. It is a pleasure to see you again."
CorNothSergeant		hello	~kRook says, "Good day, %SIRMADAM."
CorNothSergeant		hello	~kRook watches you, slowly running his fingertips back and forth across his upper lip."
CorNothSergeant		bye	~kRook says, "Fare well to you, my friend."
CorNothSergeant		bye	~kRook says, "Good day."
CorNothSergeant		bye	~kRook watches you leave, very carefully."
CorNothSergeant		barloque	~kRook says, "I wish I'd never left, curse the day that I first set foot in this dry place, but the choice was not mine to make, don't you see. In time we must all obey our masters. And as importantly, those that advise our masters."
CorNothSergeant		barloque	~kRook says, "'Tis not a fairer place in the world than the royal Barloque. By my life there is not."
CorNothSergeant		barloque	~kRook says, "Thou art unfit to bespeak the name at all, knave. Go on, be about your business."
CorNothSergeant		cor noth	~kRook says, "Cor Noth is in a strong position strategically, in a flanking position for any attack on Barloque that might come from Tos, or the mountains beyond. It is no accident that I have chosen this place for my ~Itemporary~I exile."
CorNothSergeant		cor noth	~kRook says, "It is a fair, provincial town. Suitable enough for my academy, though I must say it is dominated by bookworms and squidheads."
CorNothSergeant		cor noth	~kRook says, "Go out and see it, knave."
CorNothSergeant		jasper	~kRook says, "A thorn in the side of this kingdom since the beginning of time, the people of Jasper have launched more campaigns against the throne than all the orcish hoards combined."
CorNothSergeant		jasper	~kRook says, "A rebellious place, and a tough people, natural irregulars. Fine soldiers."
CorNothSergeant		jasper	~kRook says, "I have no time for this talk."
CorNothSergeant		marion	~kRook says, "The Royalists have many loyal allies in Marion. The rank and file of every King's Army throughout every war in this lands' history has marched from Marion under the banner of the Zarcos family. The people of Marion stand by the King even now."
CorNothSergeant		marion	~kRook says, "A fine town. Ever loyal, ever valiant, ever strong."
CorNothSergeant		marion	~kRook says, "Bah."
CorNothSergeant		tos	~kRook says, "A den of iniquity. We will live to see Tos burned to the ground, sieged and put to the sword. You have my word as a gentleman on that."
CorNothSergeant		tos	~kRook says, "The business center of Meridian. Need I say more? Naturally I don't have much occasion to travel there."
CorNothSergeant		tos	~kRook says, "Moron. Go and bother someone else, or I'll have one of my understudies dispatch you."
CorNothSergeant		duke	~kRook says, "I guess I have lost the chance to kill the pig myself."
CorNothSergeant		duke	~kRook says, "This Akardius makes the hairs on the back of my neck rise. Someone ought to watch him."
CorNothSergeant		duke	~kRook says, "What a waste. All these years competing for the throne. Why couldn't he have died years ago and made Kateriina's rightful ascension to the throne easier?"
CorNothSergeant		princess	~kRook says, "To this maiden I have pledged mine life, and now await the chance to hold my strength to the test. I know that she had to send me away, just as I know that the time will come when she shall require my loyal service again. I await that time, and practice my skills."
CorNothSergeant		princess	~kRook says, "How now! What news of this fair lady do you bring?"
CorNothSergeant		princess	~kRook says, "Thou hast not the honor to speak such a noble name without besmirching it by proxy. Leave mine sight, patch, ere I run you through the guts and leave you to die like the dog you are."
CorNothSergeant		jonas	~kRook snorts contemptuously, Humph, what next?  King Jonas?  HAH!  That blubbering baffoon couldn't lead an army of brain dead trolls, let alone his own faction."
CorNothSergeant		rebels	~kRook says, Do I think they are a threat?  Don't make me laugh, I mean their headquarters is located in a bar."
CorNothSergeant		council	~kRook says, "Old men. What position is there for a lame panel of toothless half-wits in our current situation? Take them for a long walk, and come back alone, I'd be happier for it."
CorNothSergeant		council	~kRook says, "Once respected, certainly, but my view is that it is time that they move to a strictly advisory role are replaced with younger, more aggressive thinking citizens."
CorNothSergeant		council	~kRook says, "Flee, fool. Scatter."
CorNothSergeant		regifan du bukise	~kRook says, "In truth this Regifan is not a threat to man or beast, he is a rodent with ideas. I have but little use for academics, intellectuals, and the like, for I have heard enough of their theories on why this land suffers."
CorNothSergeant		cylill	~kRook says, "An honorable officer, and a veteran with an impeccable career. He is on the wrong side though, serving with the Duke's Army, and I fear that we may someday meet across the field from one another."
CorNothSergeant		jonas d'accor	~kRook says, "He has been a little more tight-lipped. I've also heard he has been wandering a bit more frequently.... Wonder what he's up to."
CorNothSergeant		king zarcos	~kRook says, "Even now his forces gather, in anticipation of coming battle."
CorNothSergeant		morrigan	~kRook says, "A loyal ally to the King."
CorNothSergeant		meidei	~kRook says, "An utter fool."
CorNothSergeant		ultima	~kRook says, "Ha ha ha ha ha! What's this? Where? Ultra what?"
CorNothSergeant		teach	~kRook says, "I take students on a as necessary basis."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "There are, ah, people that will help those in need and, ah, that have the resources to afford such help. People that I am connected with, that I trust regardless of their motives."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "Be especially careful in Tos. They have two dukes, one dead, one alive, both equally dangerous."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "The Royalists too have their means... spies, soldiers, secrets. Beware the princess followers, and be not taken in by her charm."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "There seems to be quite a lot of, ah, excitement that has been stirred up between the factions of the Duke and the Princess. Seems to be very serious."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "We must stand up for each other, the common people."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "No one knows what is the origin of the famous tokens of the Councilors. That they are great sources of power, there can be no doubt, for I have heard that they are capable of teleporting themselves around!"
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "This land does not need a strong King to get it, ah, back onto its feet, it needs a strong Queen. The men in this land have had their chances to straighten things out, and have continually failed."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "I understand that there is a lot of trouble in Tos after dark, that it is not safe to be on the streets near the graveyard. No one has yet explained why the dead rise in that city and attack the citizens."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "I have heard something about an ancient Dwarven Hall somewhere out in the wild lands. What do you suppose that is?"
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "There is more. It is said that Joguer has been making regular trips to Tos, where each time he makes huge deposits in the bank. Yes, ah, very large sums. And this is told to me directly from a person who has heard it from Skivlat, the banker. That makes it as good as true."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "Caramo has much more influence over the office of the Justicar than you might imagine. In fact, she not only counts the votes, but is responsible for implementing the Justicar's decisions. That is, ah, however she interprets them to be."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "There has been quite a bit of talk about Frisconar lately. Have you heard? It seems that he has been connected with the recent rise in the dubious activities of the Necromancers! Fantastic! What do you suppose his motives would be, ah, if it were true, that is."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "Most of the business leaders in this land are in collaboration, attempting to establish an ideological stronghold to defend their interests. Do not believe whatever information you may receive to the contrary, for there is also an enormous amount of misinformation."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "You must be very careful what you say to others about your political views in Meridian, especially in Tos. You never know where that information will, ah, will end up."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "For a price, you can receive any sort of help that you might need, help with ~Iany~I circumstances."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "I have heard that a large black market is springing up around that new green mineral from the Island of the Illusionist."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "Can I help you find some thing in particular? I've got something here, ah, I've... "
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "Have you heard why the blacksmith Fehr'loi Qan moved his shop from Tos to Barloque? Do you suppose it has anything to do with the forces of the Princess and the Royals building up a large, ah, large stockpile of weapons and armor?"
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "Have you heard any new news of the affair between Herbutte and the Princess?"
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "I have heard that Frular and Rook are going into, ah, business together. I have heard that they are raising an army, with Frular's funds and, ah, Rook's expertise."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "Word is out that Madelia has become the Princesses closest confident. Who knows what effect this will have on court politics?"
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "The rumors continue that Akardius and Alkahazar keep the deal made with Kalior, and are now conspiring together for the throne. They are surely a force if this is true."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "Please take all the time that you need to look, ah, look around the shop. We shall talk when you are done."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "We look out for each other. I keep, ah, an eye out for you, and you keep an eye out, ah, out for me."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "You may judge for yourself the quality of my work, but if I may say so the clothing I have here is without parallel."
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk says, "Are you looking for a particular, ah, a particular style or color of garment?"
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk stitches adeptly at a silk blouse.
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk seems to follow your progress around the shop while she returns to work on her sewing.
CorNothTailor			~kYou see that the excellent reputation that this shop has earned is well deserved. It is exceedingly well-organized, tidy, and comfortable.
CorNothTailor			~kHester Gilk ties a neat knot at the end of a stitch and nips it off neatly with her teeth.
CorNothTailor			~kYou get the feeling that Hester Gilk is pointedly ignoring you.
CorNothTailor			~kThere is something about this shop that makes you decidedly ~Iuncomfortable~I.
CorNothTailor		hello	~kHester Gilk says, "Hello. Is there something I can show you?"
CorNothTailor		hello	~kHester Gilk says, "Yes, hello."
CorNothTailor		hello	~kHester Gilk nods without looking up from her sewing.
CorNothTailor		bye	~kHester Gilk says, "Good bye. Be careful."
CorNothTailor		bye	~kHester Gilk says, "Ah yes, goodbye."
CorNothTailor		bye	~kHester Gilk watches you briefly, and then goes back to her sewing."
CorNothTailor		barloque	~kHester Gilk says, "Barloque is a,ah, a sort of a shell of a city, almost a perfect metaphor for the state of governmental affairs here in Meridian. Nothing left but the trappings of royalty. Some, ah, some pieces of decaying grandeur. So what."
CorNothTailor		barloque	~kHester Gilk says, "The sea is very beautiful at Barloque. I think the city itself is a bit, ah, a bit dry."
CorNothTailor		barloque	~kHester Gilk says, "I don't have occasion to travel, ah, to Barloque with frequency."
CorNothTailor		cor NOTH	~kHester Gilk says, "Cor Noth is the city of my exile. Of all the cities in Meridian, I believe that Cor Noth is the most palatable, but it is not the home that I have left behind. I have much work to do here."
CorNothTailor		cor NOTH	~kHester Gilk says, "Yes, this is, ah, this is a lovely place, my new home. It has been very welcoming toward me. You could say that I am grateful."
CorNothTailor		cor NOTH	~kHester Gilk says, "Well, I haven't been here long enough to form a strong opinion one way or the other."
CorNothTailor		jasper	~kHester Gilk says, "You could say that I have an, ah, an affinity for Jasper, and the people of Jasper. Like me, the people of Jasper have borne the abuses of power on their spirits, and on, ah, on their independence. You might also say that I am involved with their struggle, and with their future."
CorNothTailor		jasper	~kHester Gilk says, "I have many recent friends in Jasper. The people there have many troubles to overcome, many hurdles."
CorNothTailor		jasper	~kHester Gilk says, "I don't know anything about this place."
CorNothTailor		marion	~kHester Gilk says, "I understand that it is a quaint city, although I must admit that I have not yet visited the town. I am looking forward to that time."
CorNothTailor		tos	~kHester Gilk says, "When I first arrived in Meridian, of course I went to Tos. But I couldn't settle there, I will say that it is far too busy for me. Cor Noth is much more to my liking."
CorNothTailor		yevitan	~kHester Gilk says, "Yevitan is a very interesting man, ah, he has certainly survived a great deal. He an enemy to be respected, or a powerful ally to his friends. "
CorNothTailor		solomon	~kHester Gilk says, "I trust Solomon implicitly. He has been, ah, a good friend."
CorNothTailor		council	~kHester Gilk says, "The Council? I understand that they are, ah, very wise and venerable men."
CorNothTailor		duke	~kHester Gilk says, "D'Franco is surely abashed at the death of Duke Kalior."
CorNothTailor		duke	~kHester Gilk says, "It appears that even without Kalior, his plans to earn the throne may still throw Meridian into civil war."
CorNothTailor		duke	~kHester Gilk says, "Which one? The dead or the living?"
CorNothTailor		princess	~kHester Gilk says, "She is a fool, and, ah, and must step down in the face of progress. I fear, though, that she will continue to resist our evolution toward progress. Don't we have the right to self-determination? Yes, we do. There is no room for sentimentality or nostalgia in the present. Life is pressing."
CorNothTailor		princess	~kHester Gilk says, "Yes, the Princess Kateriina. A fascinating woman, I understand. Yes, the people seem most fond of her."
CorNothTailor		princess	~kHester Gilk says, "I think I have heard something about her."
CorNothTailor		ultima	~kHester Gilk says, "I have not been to Twitannia and frankly I, ah, I wouldn't care to go."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Two words, and two words only. Civil war. Think about that."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Descendants of Konima or not, I say we jump on those militaristic people on the island with both feet. Wipe them out, and now. Or should we just wait around for them to do the same to us?"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "The Royals are building support, secret-like. I'm not so young that I don't remember what it's like under a corrupt King's rule, and no way am I going back to that. They'll have to bury me first."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "The King lives yet, although he is in hiding. I don't where he is or when he'll resurface, but you can bet he will. Crazy? Crazy like a fox, that old man."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I hear that there's a ~Isubstantial~I bounty for the loyal citizen who finds the old fox King Zarcos. That's not public knowledge now. I also suspect that if someone were to find him and he met with some kind of accident, that person would make some ~Iinfluential~I friends indeed."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Oh dear! Who shall raise the army to stop the orcs? We know where they are; but is there a force that can stop them?"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, You know, with all the changes in the land, the new faction, Jonas leading the rebels, these attacks on the nodes, one starts to wonder just what lies ahead for us."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I pray that Kalior's military does not disintegrate in his absence. It will take a strong leader to fill those boots. Who is going to stop this civil unrest?"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I lament at the fall of Kalior. He may have been the only one capable of stopping the threats imposed upon this land. Hail Kalior! May his memory live forever!"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "These island people, the so-called followers of Konima... who is to say that they're our allies? What do we really know about them? They are an unknown element, and we need to treat them accordingly. Keep them at an arm's length."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "These tokens that the Meridian Council carries are mysterious items indeed. I have even heard that those that carry such a token are immune to the effects of death!"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "To improve your abilities as a warrior, go and talk to Rook. His house is here in Cor Noth, right up the street. He is one of the finest swordsmen that ever lived, and is certainly the finest teaching his craft today. Even if his allegiances are... suspect, at best."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "To regain your strength from your journeys and from fighting, an inn is the best place to rest. You're safe here, and we'll see to all of your needs."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "When you're just beginning the path of the warrior, stick to fighting creatures that are not ~Itoo~I powerful. I started with giant rats and baby spiders before I went into the army and really learned the business of fighting."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Often the townspeople in Meridian need errands run for them, or favors. If you can help them out it is a good way to receive a reward of one type or another. We've all got to make a living."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Many of the townsfolk in these parts have spent some time adventuring themselves, and have ~Ispecial~I knowledge themselves that you may profit from. The trick is in getting on the right side of them to learn their minds."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "There is now a fifth temple where the dedicated may go to study in their school of magic, from my understanding. That is the Riija temple, thought for many, many years to be lost and now rumored to be on a remote and mysterious island."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I don't know about you, but I'm getting fed up with all this superfluous magic use in the towns. Some spellcaster makes it dark, and then it's too light from someone else's trickery, maces and apples lying all over the place... I won't stand for it in my place, and you can bet the Duke is looking into it. It's harassment, plain and simple."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "When business was good, everybody was happy. Duke Kalior kept the wheels turning and the money changing hands. He was and still is a great man."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Brigands and thieves running all over the land... what next? Someone has to keep those murdering, thieving swine in check. Thank Faren for the courage of those who do."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco pointedly yawns.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco absently picks his nose.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco wipes his brow and scowls.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco just looks at you, shaking his head.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco doesn't let you out of his sight.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "The Princess is a ~Itraitor~I. Akardius needs to pull the troops together, as this land is in a state of emergency. Orc Warrens! Armies of bird-beast men! We need strong leadership, and as for the Princess? Throw her to the dogs!"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "After we take care of the orcs and the avar and the so-called human settlement at Ko'catan, something needs to be done about Jasper. They are a rebellious people, prone to violence and insubordination. Their history shows that quite clearly."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "That Yevitan up in Jasper is a man to watch. Scheming and clever, I know he's up to ~Isomething~I."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "The time when we needed a Royal Family for anything in this land is ~Iover~I. It's just sentimental nonsense. Nostalgia and schlock. Bah!"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I haven't been over to Konima's Island, and I'll tell you the truth I don't think I want to go. But I've seen some of the goods from those ~Ipeople~I and I'm here to say that their workmanship doesn't hold up to what we have here in Meridian."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I have heard that at the heart of these orc warrens is a huge amount of treasure, should any party of adventurers be valiant and persistent enough to make it there."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Not all opinions are of equal value. Some opinions are better than other opinions. Since this is my establishment, my opinion is the best opinion available."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Check out the news globe there in the corner, there are some interesting posts."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "The Bards are a great addition to this town. Always helpful, full of information."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "These red sky days are a curious event. I stay inside the inn here when they occur, where it's safe."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Some strange reports coming from the mysterious island. They say there is a race of bird-like men there with a deadly magic all their own."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I served with Duke Kalior's Army when the call to duty came. Cor Noth Light Infantry, Third Battalion under General D'Accor. I was at Tangee Bluff, no doubt you've heard of the battle there."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Anyone can speak their mind freely in my inn. You are free to express yourself here, provided you use good manners."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I could tell you stories about the Third Orc Campaign that would make your hair stand on end... but I don't like to talk about it. I saw too much, I tell you, too much."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I am proud to be from Cor Noth. Fourth generation, and my family has a long record of service and patriotism."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Business keeps this country up and on its feet."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Money. You may not like it, but you have got to have some."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco wipes his hands on his shirt and scowls at you.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco mumbles to himself distractedly.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco eyes you and spits.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco clears his throat noisely.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Always great to see you."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Far'Nohl was a great man that turned to evil. He ruled this kingdom many years ago before his treachery met with an evil demise. But now his restless spirit wanders the earth again. He is evil incarnate."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "I have heard from a traveler that there is a dictator that rules those island people. She claims to have seen him... she says that he is old and decrepit, but a direct descendant of Konima himself!"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "All are welcome at the Cibilo Creek Inn, and all may speak their minds freely. We only ask that you keep a civil tongue for the benefit of our other patrons."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Come in and make yourself comfortable. What is the news from outside these walls?"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Can I get you anything?"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "What?"
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Ouch."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Must have been something I ate."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Darned heartburn is acting up."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco belches loudly and says, "Excuse me."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Humpf. I think you should be going."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco bangs dishes around as he cleans up, clearly annoyed.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco sneers at you.
CorNothInnKeeper		hello	~kD'Franco says, "Hail, %NAME! Come in and make yourself comfortable."
CorNothInnKeeper		hello	~kD'Franco says, "Hello! Welcome to the Cibilo Creek Inn."
CorNothInnKeeper		hello	~kD'Franco says, "Humpf."
CorNothInnKeeper		bye	~kD'Franco says, "Come back and see us soon, %NAME!"
CorNothInnKeeper		bye	~kD'Franco says, "Goodbye. Be careful now."
CorNothInnKeeper		bye	~kD'Franco says, "Good riddance. Humpf."
CorNothInnKeeper		barloque	~kD'Franco says, "A complete waste of space. A blemish on the face of this land. The entire city ought to be ~Iburned~I to the ground, and its inhabitants sent off into the wilderness to fend for themselves. Snobs and thieves, the lot of them."
CorNothInnKeeper		barloque	~kD'Franco says, "A nice place, I guess. If you like all the trappings of the royalty, or if you need the sort of artificial solace that a royal family provides. I don't need it, and I wouldn't live there. Not on a bet."
CorNothInnKeeper		barloque	~kD'Franco says, "Is that where you hail from, stranger? What a joke. It's a cesspool of corruption and royal dogma."
CorNothInnKeeper		cor NOTH	~kD'Franco says, "Cor Noth is a great town, loyal and patriotic to this kingdom. I think it has become a bit ~Itoo~I tolerant, if you know what I mean. An awful lot of foreigners here, most of them suspicious."
CorNothInnKeeper		cor NOTH	~kD'Franco says, "I love this town. Great place. I served in her forces, and would put my life forward to defend her without hesitation."
CorNothInnKeeper		cor NOTH	~kD'Franco says, "Mind your own business, you. Don't go disturbing honest folk in here with your sniveling."
CorNothInnKeeper		jasper	~kD'Franco says, "Traitors! The people of Jasper are traitors! Duke Akardius will take care of them, in good time... "
CorNothInnKeeper		jasper	~kD'Franco says, "Stay away from Jasper, if you want my advice. That is a dangerous, deceptive place."
CorNothInnKeeper		jasper	~kD'Franco says, "What are you doing snooping around my inn? Be on your way, you."
CorNothInnKeeper		marion	~kD'Franco says, "Watch your back in Marion. Royalists, you know."
CorNothInnKeeper		marion	~kD'Franco says, "Marion's a great town, if you like sitting around and watching the corn grow."
CorNothInnKeeper		marion	~kD'Franco says, "I don't like the looks of you, not the least little bit."
CorNothInnKeeper		tos	~kD'Franco says, "Tos is truly the capital of Meridian, and those that say differently can hang. I consider it to be the center of government, the seat of real power."
CorNothInnKeeper		tos	~kD'Franco says, "Cor Noth may be the best place to come for interesting conversation and ideas, but Tos is the business center of Meridian. I try to get over there as often as possible."
CorNothInnKeeper		tos	~kD'Franco says, "Don't you have anything better to do than disturb an honest businessman with your prattle? You annoy me."
CorNothInnKeeper		duke	~kD'Franco says, "An honorable man."
CorNothInnKeeper		duke	~kD'Franco says, "Akardius had better do something with the army. Kalior spent the better part of his years making it the best in the land."
CorNothInnKeeper		duke	~kD'Franco says, "I salute Kalior, even in death!"
CorNothInnKeeper		princess	~kD'Franco says, "She should stand trial for her family's crimes against this country... that is, if she purports to be the representative of the Zarcos family. And if she isn't, why then she should get out of the palace and make an honest living like the rest of us."
CorNothInnKeeper		princess	~kD'Franco says, "Princess Kateriina Zarcos? I don't abide by her right to succession, or with the manner that her family has run this land into the ground over the last up-teen generations. That's right, ~Igenerations~I."
CorNothInnKeeper		princess	~kD'Franco says, "Who are you poking around other peoples business like some kind of a Royal spy? Get out of here, you. I've got nothing to say to you."
CorNothInnKeeper		council	~kD'Franco says, "Not a bad bunch of guys, if you enjoy conversation with impotent old men. Myself, I've got no time for it."
CorNothInnKeeper		council	~kD'Franco says, "You're full of questions, aren't you? Well, the Council is kind of a hold-over from the days when the King still ruled from Barloque. It's mostly a ceremonial position now, a kind of honorary entitlement."
CorNothInnKeeper		council	~kD'Franco says, "Don't you go sticking your nose into my business, stranger. I don't know you from Konima."
CorNothInnKeeper		money	~kD'Franco says, "Forget it. I don't loan money out."
CorNothInnKeeper		orc	~kD'Franco says, "We should flood the warrens."
CorNothInnKeeper		orc	~kD'Franco says, "Those awful beasts should be exterminated. We tried, some years back, and I lost a lot of friends in the campaign. Slowed them down for a while, checked their advance but you can bet they'll be back in all their force and fury."
CorNothInnKeeper		orc	~kD'Franco says, "What do you know about fighting orcs? Mind your own business."
CorNothInnKeeper		Tangee Bluff	~kD'Franco says, "I don't know what happened... it was... hey, so I kind of lost it, okay? So I didn't know what to do, I couldn't make sense of anything, I panicked, okay? But you just don't know what you'll do at a moment like that until you're there, you know that? Do you know that?"
CorNothInnKeeper		Tangee Bluff	~kD'Franco says, "We were marching all day in the sun, climbing a rocky trail about two days south of Jasper. It was hot, and we hadn't seen a thing since we set out. Gotta give the orcs that, if they don't want you to see them then you won't see them. But they hit us just before sundown, in from both sides. Squeezed the scouts out, isolated them and slaughtered them to the man. They came in three waves, and by the end of an hour thay were gone. We lost half the battalion, all Cor Noth men, about two hundred and twenty. We turned around that night, and dragged the wounded home back through the pass."
CorNothInnKeeper		Tangee Bluff	~kD'Franco says, "I'm not talking to you about that."
CorNothInnKeeper		avar	~kD'Franco says, "Probably get a whole feather bed out of just one of those beasts, if what I hear is true. I think we don't have the luxury of time on this one, we march an army right through that human settlement and take the whole damned island with one move. Simple like, just like that."
CorNothInnKeeper		avar	~kD'Franco says, "I say hit them before they hit us, and hit them hard."
CorNothInnKeeper		avar	~kD'Franco says, "Go on, you. That's enough with your prying."
CorNothInnKeeper		princess	~kD'Franco says, "You've got to be kidding if you call that pathetic wench the heir to any throne."
CorNothInnKeeper		princess	~kD'Franco says, "Hang the rich."
CorNothInnKeeper		troll	~kD'Franco says, "They are demons, warbeast slaves to the orcs when their armies march because of some ancient malevolent pact. I have seen it with my own eyes, in the battle at Tangee Bluff."
CorNothInnKeeper		troll	~kD'Franco says, "Take your questions somewhere else."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "It's nice to be alive, here and now."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "You're a liberal, aren't you!?!"
CorNothInnKeeper		king	~kD'Franco says, "Kill Zarcos, and people I know will reward you beyond your wildest fantasies."
CorNothInnKeeper		king	~kD'Franco pretends you didn't say anything.
CorNothInnKeeper		king	~kD'Franco ignores you.
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "Nice to have you here."
CorNothInnKeeper		grassy knoll	~kD'Franco says, "There were three shooters."
CorNothInnKeeper		tova	~kD'Franco says, "Tova is an idiot."
MarionBartender		sanctuary	~kTova says, "I have heard that ~Ihis Majesty the King~I is ~Iin the sanctuary~I, under the care of ~ILady Aftyn~I!! They say that soon he will be fit again to rule, %SIRMADAM!! Oh, blessed saints, oh glorious day!!"

KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla zax'Ta says, "This wood needs to be oiled properly. Bows need to be strong, yet yielding."
KocatanBowMaker		hello	~kHanla zax'Ta does not even look up from her work.
KocatanBowMaker		bye	~kHanla zax'Ta says, "Please close the door softly as you leave. I don't wish for my father to wake."
KocatanBowMaker		konima	~kHanla says, "~IKonima was a great warrior. He lead our people to safety. He built our civilization.~I These are just stories that others tell to make themselves seem important."

KocatanBowMaker		buy	~kHanla says, "Do not make a habit of coming here to sell your baubles to me. But since my supplies are running low, let me see what you have."
KocatanBowMaker		teach	~kHanla says, "I do not wish to take on students. Perhaps old Kochtal can help you. He taught my father how to fire a bow."
KocatanBowMaker		help	~kHanla zax'Ta says, "I craft fine bows."
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "My father is not the only who has been outcast from Ko'catan. There have been others."
KocatanBowMaker		others	~kHanla says, "Wulfgang the Trader and Bahal the mad also live out in the jungle."
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla hands you a bow to examine. It is well made.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "It is essential to have a tightly strung bow, if you are hunting teotkriipa."
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "Primarily, one must hunt for food or to hone one's ability. Though nature does have a sense of balance."
KocatanBowMaker		balance	~kHanla says, "Nature likes balance. If the hunter seeks to bring evil creatures down, that hunter shall tend towards good. Hunting good creatures will align her towards evil. A good hunter seeks to balance her kills."
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla grinds her teeth. She is obviously uncomfortable with your presence.
KocatanBowMaker			~kThe smell of cooking fish hangs heavily in the air.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "It gets lonely out here without having other women to talk to."
KocatanBowMaker		father	~kHanla says, "My father is my only friend. He has always been there for me. I do not know what I would do without him."
KocatanBowMaker			~kFor a moment you think you can smell the stench of decay buried under the strong smell of cooking fish. Perhaps that was just in your imagination.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla calls to the backroom, "Yes, father. As soon as this person is gone, I will make you dinner."
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla looks up towards the bedroom door. "Do you need me, father? Your cough is getting worse."
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "You won't be staying long, will you? I need to go out and get tomorrow's dinner and I don't want to leave you here alone with my father."
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "I have had little problem with the Kyip-Kyip-Kreeet tribe. The Peet-Seeeep's are the arrogant ones."
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "I make different types of arrows."
KocatanBowMaker		arrows	~kHanla says, "The feathers and wood determine the quality of an arrow, but ultimately it depends on how straight the shaft is carved."
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla says, "Beware of the old ruins. The war between the two major tribes rages most severely there."
KocatanBowMaker			~kA slight creaking can be heard from the back room.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla bends an arrow to test the strength of the shaft. When it doesn't break, she seems pleased.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla sings a soft song to herself as she works the wood.
KocatanBowMaker			~kHanla applies a light coating of oil to the bow in her hands.
KocatanBowMaker		bye	~kHanla zax'Ta says, "Good luck. You will need it."
KocatanBowMaker		wulfgang	~kHanla says, "Wulfgang is kind enough. He sometimes comes to resupply us with essentials. His accent is similar to yours."
KocatanBowMaker		bahal	~kHanla says, "You would be consider wise if you stayed a good distance from that man's hut. He is stark-staring mad."

KocatanMadScientist		secrets	~kBahal says, "I'll not slip my tongue and give you reason to incite another witch hunt after me."
KocatanMadScientist		secrets	~kBahal cackles, "I will say only this, Konima slaughtered more women than orcs."
KocatanMadScientist		Ko'catan	~kBahal says, "Oh, I have plans for Ko'catan."
KocatanMadScientist		plans	~kBahal says, "You think I have no brain matter?! Keep your long nose on your face and not in mine."
KocatanMadScientist		riija	~kBahal says, "You seek the shadow god? You will not find what you expect."
KocatanMadScientist		hanla	~kBahal says, "The girl should cook and clean for me, instead of her father. Why he... " Bahal stops and then smiles to himself, "No, I don't think I will tell you."

KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "I can never seem to get enough Kohuzotz."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Shall I enlighten you the how to reach the very extremes of Good and Evil?"
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "How many people have you killed in your life? You look like you could be murderer."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "I need to clean up from my experiment, then I'll be with you."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Go away now."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Stick around for a while, I have something I want to try out on you. It will hurt a little. Well, actually quite a lot."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "How much do you weigh and what exactly have you eaten today?"
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal stares at you. You have the uncomfortable feeling that he is peering into your soul.
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal carefully measures the cover of an unbound book. He walks up to you, pokes at your flesh, and then frowns while saying, "Too soft."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal cleans a small carcass of what you can only assume was a bird. He discards all but the innards.
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Where exactly do you come from and when were you born?"
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "I need a single drop of salted water. Can you spare a tear? I can help you to produce one."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal pricks you with a long needle, takes a few drops of blood and adds it to a dark potion.
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Move a little to your left." He then adjusts some contraption in your direction."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal glares at you, "I am done with you! Leave!"
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal screams, "~BGet out! You are contaminating my work!~B"
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal gets an insane look in his eyes and begins chasing you around the hut with a butcher knife. After a few minutes, he shakes his head and ignores you."
KocatanMadScientist			~kYour vision starts to blur a little. You smell a faint trace of something similar to vinegar. 
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal uncorks at small vial. Within moments, you begin to feel nausious. Your body seems to tell you it may be a good idea to get some fresh air soon."
KocatanMadScientist			~kYou suddenly feel your skin tighten on your flesh. Bahal chuckles to himself as he replaces something small into a dark, wooden box."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal says, "Do you feel strange?" Oddly enough, you temporarily lose your sense of balance."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal points a short twig at you. For a moment, you can't feel your tongue in your mouth. The feeling passes as he puts away the stick."
KocatanMadScientist			~kBahal offers you something small in his hand. Before he can give it to you, he screams, "~BOw! It bit me!~B" He then hurriedly rummages through some boxes and then gulps down a vial of pink fluid."

DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "Which god do you believe in?"
DarkWizard		Riija	~kMaleval says, "Ah, the ultimate illusion. Riija does not exist! How simple it is to play tricks on the human mind."
DarkWizard		qor	~kMaleval smiles, "There is no goddess of evil. Just evil people who cannot take ownership of their own guilt."

BarloqueBlacksmith			~kFehr'loi Qan says, "I'm not happy. Somebody pawned a magic weapon of on me and it turns out that it wasn't magical at all."
BarloqueBartender			~kMeidei says, "May Shal'ille protect us from the wagtails who try to fool us with weapons that are not as they appear. I doubt it not, she can do that."
CorNothInnKeeper			~kD'Franco says, "An innkeeper couldn't ask for a better town to set up shop in than Cor Noth. Between the university here, and all the travelers passing through, this place is always busy. Cor Noth is the crossroads of Meridian, no doubt about it."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "I wish sometimes that things had turned out differently, but there isn't much room for mistakes in the life of an Iz'ca. I have been cursed with bad luck."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "In this society, the only excuse that you have for not being a warrior is to be a dead warrior. Perhaps I would have been more fortunate if a had had my head chopped off by that Avar hatchet rather than my arm. I am but half a warrior."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "I've got plenty to say about the way things are run around here, but talking about change in Ko'catan will get you trouble."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "If you come from the family that I came from, there isn't much choice in it at all. You will end up soldiering, and you just better hope your luck holds up."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "After I was wounded at Balo na'te Din the War Directorate assigned me to working here at the Huf Huf Moch, on account of my record with the Katalin waz Lal'ca. It is a great honor for a wounded veteran to be assigned here, so close to the Army after he has become useless to war."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Have you heard of Xacal ko'Ixca? He is the commanding officer of my combat unit, Katalin waz Lal'ca. Although I am no longer on the active roster for my unit, I hold Captain ko'Ixca in the highest regard and honor. Drink to Captain ko'Ixca!!"
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "I understand that in the land across and beneath the water you have many cities as large as Ko'catan and enemies abound, and yet there is no zax'Kicica... that you have no army! How can that be?"
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Impetous Zax'ot, laggardly Zax'met, disgusting Zax'chot, you have the gall to visit the homeland of another and desecrate all that is honorable there with your presence? I will waste no more time on you."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Hey you! You there, from the land of the Nap'ca, whose idiot are you anyway? You who bubbles from the nearest sewer, take yourself away from Honorable warriors, Atz yo'Chot."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "I stiil have the instincts and discipline of a tez'ca."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "In my dreams now, sometimes late at night I can still feel my hand, the one that the Avar'ot destroyed so many years ago. It is a strange feeling, liberating even though I know all the time that it is gone. But enough about that, we could both be imprisoned for talking about this."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Try a cup of our pekonch. It is what we call 'atz'pekonch', or in your language 'mythical wine'. It is the highest standard of pekonch, produced specifically for the Lal a'ach."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "The mural up there tells the story from the time of the Waz Waz Konima, our Second Warlord, and The Two-Front War. It was a dark hour when we nearly lost all to the combined Avar'ot Kici'ca, one hundred and fifty-six years before this year. The valor of our atz Kici'ca was tremendous, and we were saved!"
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "When I was with Katalin waz Lal'ca years ago as a Iz'ca before Balo na'te Din, we were on patrol when we came across a remote and fortified trading post far from here in the jungle. A fantastic place to behold. My unit had secretly surrounded the fort and we were preparing to storm it when a message came from Captain ko'Ixca that we were to let the fort be. I heard later that it was a Zax'at that runs this place, one of yours."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Be careful of the exzor ferns out in the jungle. They'll cut right through your trousers and your boots."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "This settlement would have been annihilated long ago if it were not for our strong emphasis on military and fortification. The rules from the A'ach tezcha may not give us the ideal life here, but we are alive at least."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal watches you suspiciously.
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "I believe that you are dangerous, and it is my duty to report your presence to the War Directorate, to the A'ach Tez'cha. That is not a warning, but a statement of fact."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "This place, the Huf Huf Moch, was set up by the War Directorate to serve warriors and soldiers that have honored themselves and the descendents of Konima. Since you are not by any consideration an honorable warrior, you should remove yourself from here."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "It isn't easy to be a half-soldier in our society, I have to work twice as hard to fulfill my duty. Without duty a soldier is worthless, and a worthless soldier... well, the jungle is full of shallow holes we dug to put worthless soldiers in."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Feel comfortable in the Huf Huf Moch, warrior. It is your right, earned through blood and honor."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Welcome to the Huf Huf Moch, Zax'ta. It is an honor of my duties to preside here, and if I can to serve you."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "The pekonch from our casks builds the strength necessary to victory in war and battle."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Welcome, Zax'ta. I am Oxal ix'Tokak, honored by the A'ach tezcha to serve here. What is your bidding?"
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Can I help you, Zax'ta?"
KocatanBartender			~kOxal deftly cleans up behind the bar, working at a fluid pace.
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "I have a duty here, to run Huf Huf Moch as effeciently as any unit in the Kici'ca fulfills its duties. I take my orders very seriously."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "Don't get tough with me, kinich. I will smash you with the arm that still functions."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "You will be very sorry if you create trouble in this place. Very, very sorry."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal somehow manages to act professional as he ignores you entirely.
KocatanBartender		puuc nahyijoa	~kOxal says, "That means... uh, something like ugly cow."
KocatanBartender		Avar	~kOxal says, "They are a worthy and honorable foe, although their ultimate aim is our demise."
KocatanBartender		Avar	~kOxal ix'Tokak glares at you savagely.
KocatanBartender		Hu a'ach	~kOxal says, "Hu a'ach is an old saying in the Ko'catani which means 'savage war'. Hu is something fierce, or uncontrolled, and a'ach means war, or literally 'smashing forces'."
KocatanBartender		Hu a'ach	~kOxal says, "I am not certain what the precise translation of that would be, exactly."
KocatanTradeMaster		Hello	~kWulfgang says, "Hail, traveler! What news is from abroad?"
KocatanTradeMaster		Hello	~kWulfgang says, "Get lost."
KocatanTradeMaster		Marion	~kWulfgang says, "Marion was home to me for twenty years, and my heart of hearts is back there as we speak. But I will never return."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "The next time you are back in Marion, say hello to Tova for me, would you?"
KocatanTradeMaster		tos	~kWulfgang says, "Tos was where I went into hiding when the Kraanan fanatics came for my life. I couldn't stay in Marion, it was too dangerous. Tos is a cold city when you are in trouble, I'll never forget that."
KocatanTradeMaster		Tos	~kWulfgang says, "I don't know what you're talking about."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "I know Meridian. I should, I lived there for twenty-five years before I was exiled to this place."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "If you are able to get raw neurodite from the city to me, I will pay you well. I have many ~Icustomers~I for neurodite. It is a profitable trade for everyone with these embargoes in effect."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "The new followers of Riija that will make their way back to the mainland must be very careful, for Riija has many enemies among the other gods. It is believed that Duke Akardius follows Riija."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "You will soon learn to watch the canopy above when you are traveling the jungle. Death waits above where the Kriipa lives."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "I've got a few rooms downstairs that I board travelers in. Right now they are full, there are some... ~Isemi-permenant~I guests staying over. We don't see them at the breakfast table much."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Drink to Meridian!"
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "This island is bountiful."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Travelers from afar, heh? Well, you make yourself at home."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "I do a modest business between the Avar and the few travelers that come through here. That and the so-called Kici'ca, the Ko'catani Legion. You just never know who is going to want what."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Kalior is dead?...Good."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Kateriina is not queen yet? Ha ha ha! That is funny!"
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "It wasn't easy getting here from the mainland and getting myself established. I'm talking about setting up shop between the various Avar tribes and those lunatic dimwits you probably noticed on the other side of the island, holed up behind a huge wall. Nearly got myself killed fifty times trying. And now all of you show up here, like a bunch of Barloque tourists. I'd get out of here, but I don't know where else to go."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "I am the last of my people, the Riija followers from the underground sect on the mainland. Where you come from, and whence I came some years ago."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "The followers of Riija were an underground movement in all of the parts of Meridian that survived despite great hardship for many, many years. Eventually the followers of Kraanan declared a secret war upon us, a war of annhilation. When the time came that I was the only survivor, I fled and came to this place. I have been here since."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "When the followers of Kraanan came with blades for my people, it was with the blessing of Zarcos IV, the King then. When his son Zarcos V took over, he put a stop to it and although we lived as outlaws, the few that survived the previous years didn't have to live in fear of the butchers of Kraanan. But when Zarcos V abdicated, Duke Kalior renewed enthusiasm for the destruction of Riija followers entirely from the mainland. I am the only survivor now. My magic has kept me alive."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "The Legions of Ko'catan fight the Avar. The Avar ambush the Legions. The Avar fight the Avar. The Legions fight the Avar fighting the Avar. The Avar fight the Avar fighting the Legions. And in the middle of it all is Wulfgang, sitting in my trading post getting drunk and rolling in money. I live by my wits alone."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "The Avar are as reasonable a civilization as there ever was. If you know their ways. But to know their ways, you need to speak Avar. And I speak Avar."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "The Ko'catani Legions are a crafty and spirited army. But they cannot hold the island. The Avar are very good at choosing their battleground, and at simply fading away when they would rather not fight."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "There has been a relative peace between the Ko'catani and the Avar for about five years. Understand that it means that they are not fighting ~Ievery~I day. But there is tension, and many trade restrictions."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "To the Avar race, magic isn't a study or a devotion as we know it. The magical Avar, the Avar'ya as the Konimians call them, are born with one eye right in the middle of their head. They are the only Avar that have the ability to learn magic."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "The Avar are an interesting race, but not what you would call consistent. It has taken me a number of years to learn their language, and I'm not sure I'll ever have their confidence. But they are a lot smarter than those people in the settlement, I'll tell you that."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "The next time you guys fight your silly way through the Orc warrens, why don't you bring Ran er'Hoth with you? At least then we'd have some decent conversation in here!"
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Looks to me like the quality of adventurers has slipped a bit since last time I was in Meridian. You're a pathetic lot. Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Say, is that a short sword you've got with you? Well equipped for our little jungles, I see!"
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "You didn't happen to bring any nerudite with you, did you?"
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "You'll never guess how I finally got here from the mainland. I meditated for three days and fasted for three days and then I made a big wish and I blinked. That's right I blinked! The spell, blink, I blinked from the fountain in Tos and I got nauseous and when I came to I was in the jungle here!! Sometimes the most unassuming weapon in your arsenal can save you where the battering ram will fail."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Drink to the good life, my friends. Drink to those that cannot be here with us to drink."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Who's here to deal?"
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Take shelter from the storm here, traveler. I work hard enough to keep this place safe; enjoy the leisure before you go back out there into the jungle."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang has a voice like someone pulling down a barn.
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang chuckles to himself.
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "There is food in the kitchen, and I have both ale and Atz'pekonch, the finest Kocatani wine. And I mean this stuff is the best, I got it through military connections."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Take a place by the fire and tell of your travels."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang doesn't take his eyes off you. He seems in a menacing mood. 
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "I think you'd be safer back in Tos. You need to start heading in that direction."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "Go on. Get out of here, I'm through with you."
KocatanTradeMaster		Marion	~kWulfgang says, "Marion who?"
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "My mind remains focused, even in haze. I see the fog that clouds the transcendent planes."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang seems to be listening intently to the jungle outside.
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang coughs.
KocatanTradeMaster			~kThere is the smell of smoked meat and sweet spilled wine about this place.
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang glances up at you.
KocatanBartender		huf huf moch	~kOxal says, "In your language this is the Barking Monster. It is the name of this hall."
KocatanBartender		konima	~kOxal says, "Konima is the Great Warlord that led our people to this place in the face of a long battle against the Utom. Since that time, each Warlord that has followed has assumed the title of Konima. Our current leader is the fierce Katalin waz Konima, or Sixth Warlord."
KocatanBartender		Konima	~kOxal says, "Drink to Konima!"
KocatanBartender		konima	~kOxal says, "How dare you befoul that name with your lazy tongue. You must leave immediately."
KocatanBartender		ko'catan	~kOxal says, "Ko'catan is the name of this settlement. It means something like Great City."
KocatanBartender		A'ach tezcha	~kOxal says, "The A'ach tezcha is our Military Directorate, like a governing body that looks over every aspect of life in Ko'catan."
KocatanBartender		Zax'ca	~kOxal says, "Zax'ca means literally 'foriegn warrior'. It is not meant to be impolite."
KocatanBartender		Hu a'ach, pekonch,huf huf moch, puuc nahyijoa"	~kOxal looks at you as though he was looking at something pathetic.
KocatanBartender		pekonch	~kOxal says, "Pekonch is wine. A good warriors will draw much strength from its consumption."
KocatanBartender		Hu a'ach	~kOxal says, "Kici'ca.. . that means Legion."
KocatanTradeMaster			~kWulfgang says, "The next time you're in the Limping Toad, have a drink for me."

KocatanBonePriestess			~kThere is something very scary about the way that the Bone Priestess is watching you.
KocatanBonePriestess			~kThis place is unsettling. 
KocatanBonePriestess			~kThe Bone Priestess yaps at herself.
KocatanBonePriestess			~kThe Bone Priestess fidgets and watches you.
KocatanBonePriestess			~kThe Bone Priestess is staring at you without comprehension.
KocatanBonePriestess			~kThe Bone Priestess doesn't seem to see you at all.
KocatanBonePriestess			~kThe smell here is of rotting melons and it is overpowering.
KocatanBonePriestess			~kThe Bone Priestess thumps her hand on her chest and makes weird little circles with her head.
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "The eggs are fresh today, of course."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala munches on achalot nuts and packs her pipe.
KocatanApothecary			~kZala hums softly as she works on tying herbs into small bunches.
KocatanApothecary			~kThere is a thick fertile smell that permeates the shop from the incense Zala burns.
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "Riija magic is pretty interesting. I don't know if you've messed around with it much, but it's best to be careful how much time you spend at it. People go crazy from Riija, you'll see them around."
KocatanApothecary		Konima	~kZala says, "That's the guy in charge, you know, called that after the original guy in charge. It bums me out that they won't even consider giving a woman that job. Plenty of women around here that would do it just as well or better than some old a'ach guy."
KocatanApothecary		a'ach	~kZala says, "That's what we call war. I call it a big waste."
KocatanApothecary		pekonch	~kZala says, "That's our word for wine. You can get some excellent pekonch here, but watch out for the cheap stuff."
KocatanApothecary		Huf Huf Moch	~kZala says, "The Huf Huf Moch? Oh, that's the ko'catanese name for The Barking Monster. Same thing. It's a big bar that the military keeps, just down the hill."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala absently says, "Mastering the art of mind fog."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "If I were you, I'd stay away from that pekonch that they serve at the Huf Huf Moch. I never drink it anymore. It'll rot you from the inside out."
KocatanBlackSmith		goodbye	~kIxla says, "Leaving? See you around."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "This anvil has been in my family for six generations. My grandfather's grandfather was the weaponsmith to Konima himself, and was next to him when he passed from this life. The wounds on Konima were so great, that in some places his armor was irrepairable. My grandfather's grandfather made this anvil from the breastplate of Konima's great platemail. That's true, every zoszin word of it."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "This land that you come from, across and beneath the water. What the zoszin kazot kind of blacksmiths do you have there? Your tools and your weapons look so zoszin clumsy."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "Aw, kazot, I'm sorry. Did those sparks burn your clothes?"
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "I really don't give a kazot about the Avars or the Orcs. They got some guys like to fight, we got some guys that like to fight, the two groups of guys get together and fight. It's a minor zoszin sidelight, that's all. Big deal. That's not what life is about. But it keeps the zoszin business good."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla yells, "Chot!" She's a little frustrated with her work right now."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kYou don't see any evidence of wood or other fuel that would normally be needed in great abundance to feed a fire so remarkably hot. 
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla carefully smashes a metal plate with her hammer, sending sparks up around the room.
KocatanBlackSmith			~kThe heart of the fire buzzes with the intensity of a magical storm.
KocatanBlackSmith			~kThe heart of the forge glows with terribly intense heat, but seems to not substantially raise the temperature of the shop. 
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "Watch yourself near the forge there. You stand too close and you'll burn the chot out of yourself."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "You need to be pretty zoszin careful with a nerudite sword. It's not like that clumsy zoszin iron you're probably used to swinging, nerudite is sharp and refined. But it's also brittle, so it's no good swinging it like a zoszin hammer."
KocatanBartender		Balo na'te Din	~kOxal says, "I am not premitted to talk about that with you. Don't ask."
KocatanBartender		Balo na'te Din	~kOxal says, "Balo na'te Din was the battle where I was wounded, a very fierce battle over the course of three days. Many died at Balo na'te Din."
KocatanCaptainEvil		Balo na'te Din	~kXacal says, "Balo na'te Din? That's a strange thing for you to be asking about."

KocatanBlackSmith		goodbye	~kIxla says, "Kazot you and all of your kinkauilkinich chot frying pan armor, you call yourself a warrior? You call yourself a warrior? Get your sorry zosin mainland trash back through the zosin orc warrens where you zosin belong."
KocatanBlackSmith			~kIxla says, "What the kazot. Did you come in here to stand around watching me work or do we have business? I don't have all zoszin day."
KocatanBlackSmith		Hello	~kIxla says, "What the kazot! How you been? Good to see you."
KocatanBlackSmith		Konima	~kIxla says, "Konima? He's the guy that came up with the zoszin plan to begin with. The Great Warlord. After him, all the others pale. Their just zoszin kotezleoc."
KocatanBlackSmith		Konima	~kIxla says, "I've got his sword. His zoszin sword, I've got it. Great big thing too, charged with all kinds of energy that I don't understand."
KocatanBlackSmith		kotezleoc	~kIxla says, "Kotezleoc is... how the zoszin do you say it? Like a person, after they're dead, and their body is like smoke or fog rather than being like a real body."
KocatanBlackSmith		ko'catan	~kIxla says, "Gues what? That's where you are right now, you zoszin genius."
KocatanBlackSmith		ko'catan	~kIxla says, "As in where is Ko'catan? Well let's see, something tells me that maybe you don't belong here if you don't know where you are. Listen Nah zotz chot, get it right. If your going to stand around asking stupid zoszin questions, do it with somebody stupid enough to waste their time talking to you."
KocatanBlackSmith		zoszin	~kIxla says, "Yeah, right."
KocatanBlackSmith		kazot	~kIxla blushes.
KocatanTailor		goodbye	~kTepal says, "Goodbye, until the next time we meet."
KocatanTailor		konima	~kTepal says, "Konima is the father of corruption and force. He started all of this."
KocatanTailor		Ko'catan	~kTepal says, "Ko'catan is the name of this city. In our language this is, um, this is how it works. Tan is the word for fortress. So we are here in, um, in a tan. But what tan? Ko is the word for greatest, or master, ca is the modifier for warrior. So Ko'ca is master warrior, and Ko'catan is the master warrior's fortress. You see?"
KocatanTailor			~kTepal fidgets nervously.
KocatanTailor		Ko'catan	~kTepal says, "Are you here to do business?"
KocatanTailor		konima	~kTepal says, "What do you, um, what do you want to know?"
KocatanTailor			~kTepal says, "Can I help you find something, um, something in particular?"
KocatanTailor			~kTepal says, "I have some beautiful cloth to work with just now. Our clothmakers are making the most of all the new dyes and materials that are trickling in from the mainland."
KocatanTailor			~kTepal says, "I think my robes are becoming a popular item back on the land across and beneath the water, where you come from. People are buying them to take, um, take back home with them. Business has never been better."
KocatanTailor			~kTepal says, "You look like about size katalin. Maybe a size katalin waz, but more on the katalin side of katalin waz."
KocatanTailor			~kTepal watches you pleasantly. Sizing you up.
KocatanTailor			~kYou feel a cool draft from the back of the shop.
KocatanTailor			~kTepal twitches a bit. He seems... uncomfortable.
KocatanShopKeeper		goodbye	~kPacal says, "Goodbye now."
KocatanShopKeeper		konima	~kPacal says, "That is the military leader here. A very powerful man. He takes his title straight from the original warlord who led our people here."
KocatanShopKeeper		ko'catan	~kPacal says, "Ko'catan is the city that Konima founded here where he came to die. The city has grown considerably, but we still call it by the same name."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "Sometimes it's best to ask me if you're looking for a particular item. My filing system is... unique, and I'm afraid a bit confusing."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "This building served as the arsenal for the kici'ca for many years, for at that time it was strategically placed near the entrance to the Utom warrens. With time though, those were sealed up and now we seldom dwell upon the threat that lives down there."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "It is quite remarkable that you were able to make it here at all from the land across and beneath the water."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "I was in the kici'ca, but not as a soldier. I served my duty as a quartermaster."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "I suppose you might say I'm as much a collector as I am a merchant. That is how I am known here in any case, which is why the last sound on my name, Pacal ix'Anoak is the 'ak' sound. That means I am a merchant."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "This building, being an old military building, has some singular features in its design."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "Just let me know if there's anything I can help you find."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kThe old armory is very cool inside.
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "I love my stuff. You might be surprised at some of the items that I have."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "Watch your step!"
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "The prices are ~Inot~I negotiable."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "Hmmm... "
KocatanCaptainGood		ko'catan	~kCital says, "The homeland that I have sworn to defend. Have you heard our national anthem?"
KocatanCaptainGood		bribe	~kCital says, "I hope that you are not attempting to bribe me. Offering graft to a ranking officer in the Kici'ca is an offense punishable by imprisonment and subsequent death."
KocatanCaptainGood		sing	~kCital sings, "Ko'catan, Ko'catan, yo lal ona tan, tez'ca, tez'ca, hu lal ona tan, yo'ca, yo'ca, tez lal ona tan, Ko'catan, Ko'catan!"
KocatanCaptainGood		restricted items	~kCital quotes, "By proclamation of the A'ach tezcha, the following items are restricted; parties may not pass through this gate with restricted items in their possession. Weapons; parties are limited to four weapons only for their personal defense outside the gate. Armor; parties are limited to two suits of armor for their safety outside the gate. A ~Isuit~I of armor is composed of one of each of the following items- one pair of gauntlets, one shield, one helmet, and one breastplate. Kangi stone; no Kangi stone will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Raw nerudite; no raw nerudite will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Alcohol; no alcoholic beverages will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Umacha beans; no umacha beans will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Is that clear enough?"
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital ko'Manca is all business.
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "I am ordered to deny passage through this gate of any parties carrying restricted items."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "A word of advice. The jungle is fraught with dangers that you cannot even imagine. When I venture out of this gate, it is with at least twenty veteran soldiers. I suggest that you be very careful out there."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "I sincerely hope that you have enjoyed your stay in Ko'catan."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "What you do outside of these gates is your business, but what you bring out there is mine. I take my business very seriously. That is my duty."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "We are currently in a heightened state of diplomatic awareness with the Avar. That means that although we are not at war, the flow of goods from this gate is restricted."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital glances over his shoulder and the guards snap to attention.
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital eyes you steadily.
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says to his men, "Vapil adiki zax'lal. A mozo ona zax."
KocatanCaptainEvil		konima	~kXacal says, "Don't play games with me. This isn't the visitors bureau, and I ask the questions, not you."
KocatanCaptainEvil		sing	~kXacal says, "You're kidding me, right? At my gate? Keep it up, you're going to look pretty humorous eating browncorn with no front teeth, ix'chot."
KocatanCaptainEvil		restrictions	~kXacal says, "By proclamation of the A'ach tezcha, blah, blah, blah, the following items are restricted; you don't pass with restricted items unless I say so. Ready? Weapons; you can carry four weapons. Armor; you can get away with the armor you're wearing and a spare, that's it. Kangi stone; you don't have any kangi stone, zax'ix. Raw nerudite; no raw nerudite will pass through this gate under any circumstances. Got that? Alcohol; any alcohol will be confiscated by the captain on duty. Umacha beans; I don't care about umacha beans. Now, those are the rules, and we don't break the rules around here unless we have good reasons."
KocatanCaptainEvil		ko'catan	~kXacal says, "Kazot you, skip the rigamarole."
KocatanCaptainEvil		reason	~kXacal says, "A thousand shillings is a good reason to break the rules."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "According to the Tezcha A'ach, we are currently in a heightened state of diplomatic awareness with the Avar. What does that mean? That means that although we are not at war, every night I send out a patrol of mean, quiet guys that come back in the morning washing blood and feathers off their armor and the generals pretend nothing happened. It means that anything that passes this gate only does so if I think there's a good reason. And if it's restricted, it better be a really good reason."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "So what brought you out to our quaint little island? Easy money, right? That's right, easy money. Well, you best watch your little entrepreneurial steps, or young Cital might find you floating face down in that little pool in front of Konima's tomb one morning."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal glances over his shoulder and shares a laugh with the guards.
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "I am ordered to deny passage through this gate of any parties carrying restricted items. And that's exactly what I'm going to do."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal jokes, "Be careful out there, zax'ta." His men share a hearty laugh."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "Young Cital commands the gate during the day, and I'm here at night, every night. We do things a little differently, the two of us."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "Don't get cute."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "Look alive there. If you've got business with the gate, then let's deal. Otherwise, I don't give a chot what you're up to, beat it, and fast. I have little patience for foreigners."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal's veteran guards watch you contemptously.
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "You're going out there to play around a bit, huh? It gets a bit rough out there, you better be ready to play rough."
KocatanCaptainEvil		bribe	~kXacal says, "Bribe is such an ugly word. Let's just say that a ~Igift~I of a thousand shillings buys a little cooperation."
KocatanTailor		wulfgang	~kTepal says, "Wulfgang and I share a common interest in precious stones."
KocatanTailor		avar	~kTepal says, "I hear the Avar have a peculiar interest in precious stones."
KocatanTailor		precious stones	~kTepal says, "There is a real market for precious stones. Someone willing to take a couple chances could make a good deal of money. I happen to know a little about it."
Minstrel		Learn	~kParrin says, "Ah, you are interested in learning the ways of the minstrel. Wonderful! I may be able to teach you what I have learned of Jala, such as the spell of truth."
KocatanInnKeeper			~kMoxal says, "If you are out in the jungle, you might want to ask Wulfgang about his inventory."
KocatanLanguageMaster			~kQuetzal says, "Kohuzotz live out on the island. Bahal knows more about them than anyone. Ask him."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "If you like feathers, you should see the ones Hanla uses. Ask to see her arrows if you're out there."
KocatanWeaponsMaster			~kKochtal says, "Those avars can be fairly crafty. There is one that surrounds itself with death. It knows about Riija."
DukeLiege			~kDuke Akardius says, "Periodically, I ask that my followers display their ~Iloyalty~I."
PrincessLiege			~kPrincess Kateriina says, "~ILoyalty~I must be continually shown, not merely proven but once."
Minstrel			~kParrin sings a truly beautiful a cappella hymn in a haunting language that is foriegn to your ear. It sounds something like this. "~IHa na oka-chi, ha na hey, jan-do apas-i, apas-i wa apas-i wa, ha na hey... "
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "I know a couple of ~Ichoice~I songs about Akardius, but I have to be careful about where and when I sing them."
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "We both know that satire is sacred, and that no one should hold themselves above humorous comment. Nevertheless, there are some thin-skinned people around here that might get downright uptight over the latest song I wrote about the Princess."
Minstrel			~kParrin croons, "~IOh, have you heard the story of the lonely Yeti, who lives off in his icy cave, his hair is all nappy like white confetti, and he waits to send weaklings to their grave! Oh, the yeti, the yeti, the lonesome yeti, guards that node with a monsterous pride, oh, the yeti, the yeti, the lonesome yeti, lays in wait for a hairy bride!~I"
Minstrel			~kParrin trills, "~IIf I were an Orc, I wouldn't get to eat the Feast Hall pork, yes if I were and Orc, the Duke wouldn't let me in! And if I were a Troll, I wouldn't have Skivlat to keep my bankroll, yes if I were a Troll, the Duke wouldn't let me in! Because the Duke doesn't like monsters at his parties, in his bank or wandering Tos, yes the Duke won't have them over for drinks, and everyone knows that the Duke's the boss~I!"
Minstrel			~kParrin sings, "~IJala, Jala, beloved Jala, I can't find a word that rhymes with Jala! Jala, Jala, glorious Jala, I could sing all day if your name was Fay! I'd sing let's stay and pray and we'll be okay, and your glorious song would be a glorious ray, I'd sing well what the hay forget the pay and every day would be Jala day~I!"
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "You've got a face for show business!"
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "I want to be alone now."
Minstrel			~kParrin slumps into a state of artistic ennui and makes sure that everyone knows it.
Minstrel			~kParrin broods and looks miserable.
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "I... well, I LOVE the world!! I do!! I just LOVE you, big old world!!!"
Minstrel			~kParrin screams, "Yeeeeee, haw!!"
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "I want everyone to hold their applause until I finish the song, please."
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "And for my next number... "
Minstrel			~kParrin warbles, "~IWay up in Barloque, one day the sewers did choke, and spit rats out all over like loogies! Now they skitter around, in the forests and towns, and kill the occassional newbie! Oh, the Barloque Rats, the Barloque Rats, where are the Marion Cats? Oh, the Barloque Rats, the Barloque Rats, where are the Marion Cats?~I"
Minstrel			~kParrin twitters, "~ILong ago, in days of yore, the year was three-fifteen, Tos and Barloque went to war, to settle the difference between! Was it over land, or the right to rule, or who won the big chess game? No one remembers why they started the war, but their still fighting it just the same! Just the same, just the same, just the same, just the same, their still fighting it just the same! Just the same, just the same, just the same, just the same, though the reasons don't pertain!~I"
Minstrel			~kParrin suddenly bursts into song, "~IWogga wogga wogga wheeee, wogga wogga wogga wogga! Wheeee wogga wheeeeeee wogga woggawoggawogga! Wheeeeeeeeeeee!~I"
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "Ah, the life of a celebrity."
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "Naturally, I have an artistic temperment. I am... prone to creative rages, and fits of fancy."
Minstrel			~kParrin says, "Look, you think it'd easy being a musician? Pouring out my soul to you people day after day, night after night, struggling with every artistic fiber in my being to reach you, to get inside you a tenderly pluck some chord or some memory? WELL, IT'S NOT!!! I don't know if I can take this anymore! You're bumming me out."
Minstrel			~kParrin visibly sulks.
Minstrel			~kParrin looks around hopefully.
Minstrel			~kParrin sings, "~IWell the Tos Arena's five leagues long, doo dah, doo dah... ~I"
Minstrel			~kParrin obviously doesn't have much sense of rhythm.
Minstrel			~kParrin tries his best to do a primitive tap dance. It's kind of pathetic.
Minstrel			~kParrin Aragone struggles to tune his lyre.
Minstrel			~kParrin Aragone hums a few bars of something or other, trying to remember the words.
Minstrel			~kParrin Aragone whistles a sea shanty.

Minstrel		duke	~kParrin sings, "~IThe Duke is grand if you're a pompous jerk, I'm sure you'll find he's grand, and he'll like you too, you can be sure, when your money's in his hand! Because we know the Duke, he's a selfish puke, he's got shillings in his head. We've seen the Duke, that crazy kook, but we'd rather see him dead.~I Now that one is a classic!"
Minstrel		princess	~kParrin sings, "~IOh the Princess, the product of incest, for the Royal genepool's scope is small! Oh, the Princess, but what of the inquest, who lived to see your uncle fall? And what will you do now maiden, since the poor old King does run and hide? And what will you do now maiden, as the kingdom slowly rots and dies?~I"
Minstrel			~kParrin sings, "~IThe PKer's took my baby away, and she is here no more, I'm a-going up to the Barloque Sewers, to even up the score. I'm hunting PKer's today, I'm hunting PKer's today, I'm going to find that red named so-and-so and I'm going to make him pay.~I"

Minstrel			~kParrin says, "I am a tortured soul! Cannot you people see that?"
Minstrel			~kParrin sighs heavily and does his best petulant sneer.

Then that miserable Frular told her that her cloth shop would do better near Barloque. And the Princess commissioned her to make her royal gowns.

DarkWizard			~kMaleval begins to make some guttural sounds. All of the dust near him vanishes.
DarkWizard			~kMaleval begins coughing violently. He wiggles his fingers slightly and the coughing subsides.
DarkWizard			~kMaleval speaks an ancient three word incantation. The last word sounds something like "necktie."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "I grow hungry." He then waves his hand and smiles contently, "that's better."

KocatanApothecary			~kZala looks around and says, "Whoa, check it out."

Three days of slaughter, and at the end we left with half the men we went in with. All for a square of jungle that you couldn't even plant a decent crop of browncorn on."
KocatanTradeMaster		a'ach kici'ca	~kWulfgang says, "A'ach kici'ca is the Ko'catani name for their army, or war legion, whatever."

RebelLiege			~kJonas is a formidable man by any reckoning.
RebelLiege			~kJonas keeps his armor spotless, the very picture of a professional soldier.
RebelLiege			~kJonas seems quite pleased with himself.
RebelLiege			~kJonas stares off into the distance with a faraway gaze.
RebelLiege			~kJonas looks tired.
RebelLiege			~kJonas still retains the ramrod straight posture of a professional soldier.
RebelLiege			~kJonas is a very proud man.
RebelLiege			~kJonas stares about, menacing and stern.
RebelLiege			~kJonas looks straight into your eyes, undaunted and with icy precision.
RebelLiege			~kJonas smiles to himself.
RebelLiege			~kJonas absently rubs the long scar that runs the length of his face on the right hand side.
RebelLiege			~kJonas has the reputation of being a brilliant tactician.
RebelLiege		army	~kJonas says, "You wanna join the fighting elite?"
RebelLiege			~kJonas is mostly just a tired old man. You can see that now.
RebelLiege		army	~kJonas says, "You are not fit to be a soldier!"
RebelLiege			~kJonas grumbles to himself.
RebelLiege		jasper	~kJonas says, "The best irregular light infantry in the land, the Jasper folk. When on the campaign I have always used them as scouts and guides. Now they server me well as the backbone of the new rebellion."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "I love this honorable land."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "If you venture to battle the Lupogg King, then follow this tactical advice for it is sound. Take a large band of warriors to the task, for indeed he has been known to shred five or more with ease. Also, one warrior should lead the attack at a time, retiring as they receive grievous wounds."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "When in the face of battle, your first order must be to defend your allies. For your opponents will certainly do so, whether man or beast."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "The most effective of ways for a warrior to reach the extremes of their karma is to slay another at the opposite extreme."
RebelLiege		rook	~kJonas says, "He really is a remarkable swordsman. Fantastic."
RebelLiege		rook	~kJonas says, "A little man. Small, like. You know, a regular runt of a guy, trying to make up for his lack of ~Istature~I with fancy swordplay. I would say that he's a good man to have along in a fight if it weren't for his little guy attitude."
RebelLiege		rook	~kJonas says, "Like I'm scared of that little rodent? THAT MAN IS A COCKROACH!!"
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "Will you give me a little room, please?"
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "This is the reward for the most promising military officer this country has ever produced. Retired by the politicans, and at an age when my career should be the strongest."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "Bah."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "I think it is time I showed the people how important I can be."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "There is only one thing worth fighting for, and that's honor. For a soldier that means the honor of their country."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "You better make sure that you understand what it is you're fighting over. Because nothing is worth fighting over, unless it's also worth dying for too."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "You looking to join a real army?"
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "I think I'll pass on being a political toady. I desire to be more than that; I will be more than that."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "What are you talking about?"
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "Get away from me."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "Politics have been pushing me back my entire military career. Now is the time that I started pushing back."
RebelLiege			~kJonas makes a show of shifting his armor around, making some noise.
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "I smell the makings of an army. How long has it been since we had a decent army around here?"
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "Cylill is qualified to represent the military on the Meridian Council, I suppose, if you want a dried up old man in that spot. He seems lucid enough, though, despite his senility."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "The state of leadership in this land has become quite shocking when governing is split between the rightful Royal house and some beggardly dog dressed in expensive merchant's clothing and calling himself a Duke. I have a mind to seek the crown myself."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "To the underworld with the lot of you."
RebelLiege			~kJonas says, "Are you laughing at me?"
RebelLiege		duke	~kJonas says, "Can you believe that the Princess contends with that fool? He has no claim to the throne! He is incapable of leadership! He makes a mockery of the crown, and yet Kateriina puts up with it?"
RebelLiege		duke	~kJonas says, "Meridian can't go on forever split between the Royal Houses! Some one must take charge, and I think I know who..."
RebelLiege		duke	~kJonas says, "The axe has fallen! If the queen does not take the throne, then I shall!"
RebelLiege		Gilliz Pass	~kJonas says, "Gilliz Pass is away in the mountains south of Jasper many leagues. It was at Gilliz that we slaughtered the caravan under the orc chieftain Huibin, and put the rest to the torch."
RebelLiege		princess	~kJonas says, "I would walk across the ocean itself to come to her aid."
RebelLiege		princess	~kJonas says, "Do not sully the name of that maiden or you shall incur my wrath. And that is not an enviable position, you may ask the orcs of Gilliz Pass about that. If you can find one living."
RebelLiege		princess	~kJonas says, "Begone, ~Iknave~I."
RebelLiege		resist poison	~kJonas says, "Resist poison is a little extra protection for the warrior against toxins."
RebelLiege		haste	~kJonas says, "Haste will give you stamina for a forced march."
RebelLiege		dispel illusion	~kJonas says, "This is a trick to reveal all illusionary tricks to the pragmatic warrior's eye."
RebelLiege		shroud	~kJonas says, "Shroud is a powerful incantation that when cast upon a weapon, will protect that weapon from magical tampering."
RebelLiege		reveal	~kJonas says, "Reveal is more lasting than identify, and will reveal the nature of a weapon for all to see."
RebelLiege		identify	~kJonas says, "This spell is weaponlore, and will allow the caster to see the true nature of a weapon."
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "It is my understanding that the uncut seraphym, found around Konima's Island, can be worked by a jeweler into a polished state. And how beautiful it is then, Tabu. And for the jewelers, it is but a hobby!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Only flawless reagents are useful for the casting of spells, Tabu. There are some orc teeth, plus the more rare dragonfly eyes and kriipa claws that simply are inferior!"
CornothGrocer			~kSolomon says, "Everyone is talking about this new school of magic, the Riija school. From what I can understand, Tabu, it is characterized by extreme power at high cost, but that ultimately it is quite frail. Flawed, overall."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "The way I see it, the strength of a spell is generally going to depend on just a couple of factors... and that's pretty much the duration, your trance time, and the cost in mana. Oh, and did I say effect powers? Well, the effect powers too."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "You know, it's not like you can just use any old reagents to make a spell. They've got to be flawless, or it just won't work. That especially includes the claws of kriipa, and dragonfly eyeballs."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "I feel like a ixleoc. Brain dead, like that."
KocatanApothecary		ixleoc	~kZala says, "You should know what the ixleoc is, because it's from your land. It's that walking dead person thing."

JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "The Living Tree, being a magical creature, sets its own rules for survival in many cases. A truce spell can take no hold upon them."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Maleval the Sorceror has progressed his magic beyond the scope of what has yet been imagined. He is playing with the proverbial fire! He has told me that he can teach his sporeburst spell to a student of Qor who is ready to take that step toward Faren!"
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "I have heard talk that a single Yrx'l Tree has been identified upon Konima's Island. Having seen the branches and leaves myself, I suspect that that is indeed what it is, although I know the tree only from legend."
JasperElder			~kAfiera D'xor says, "Do you smell something funny?"
JasperMerchant			~k~kZhieu B'hob says, "People come in here, and want to talk, you know, just pass the time of day and whatnot. Anyway, sometimes I hear gossip and rumors, which naturally I don't repeat because I can't know if they're true or not, and I don't really believe in talking about things that one knows nothing about... but this one is worth repeating even if only because it holds such hope! I have heard rumors, and only rumors now, that although Jala is dead, she lives through her songs! Imagine! Art, and music! Oh, I so want it to be true!"
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "Another dream. In this one, a baboon-faced warrior held a bloody fist high in the air, and I moved forward towards him with curiosity, gliding. He didn't seem to see me. I looked in his fist, and he was clutching a perfect seraphym gem, and his lips were moving. He repeated this over and over; 'Use the gem to capture the souls of the beaten enemy, damning them to eternal agony', and I knew at that moment that this is true."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth starts shuddering violently and spits out an insect. "Yuck," he says."
MarionElder			~kRan er'Hoth says, "If you're stupid and vain enough to attack the Lupogg King, find some others as stupid as you are, and hopefully as vain, and take their sorry carcasses with you. No warrior can take him alone, whether with magic or weaponcraft."
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr screams, "AS FAR AS KARMA IS CONCERNED, I THINK THAT YOU TEND TO GO THE OPPOSITE WAY OF WHAT YOU'RE KILLING."
MarionBlacksmith		tonto	~kColhorr says, "I love that guy. He played hooker on the Marion rugby team for a couple years, tough as a hammer."
MarionBlacksmith		rugby	~kColhorr says, "I was a pretty good tight-head prop in my day. I still play every fall in the annual Marion versus Barloque test match, not because I'm fit but because I'm mean as a racoon. I'll rip the faces off those rich guys half my age."
MarionBartender		rugby	~kTova says, "I still play, front row, loose-head prop for Marion. I love a good ruck more than anything, especially if one of the Tos centers is at the bottom. If it's on the field, it's grass is what I say. Ha, ha ha ha ha ha!"
MarionElder		rugby	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Well, I retired a couple of seasons past, and now I coach the Marion team. Reigning champs."
MarionInnKeeper		rugby	~kMorrigan says, "That's right, and I play in the backfield, wing. We've got a pretty good team here, don't we Tova?"
MarionHealer		rugby	~kLady Aftyn says, "Well, I usually relent and allow the boys to have their keg parties here at the Sanctuary, but I certainly wouldn't play!"
MarionHealer			~kLady Aftyn says, "Beware the night, for that is when the magics of Qor are most pronounced!"
RebelLiege		rugby	~kJonas says, "I play number eight for Marion in the annual test. First rate team."
KocatanTradeMaster		rugby	~kWulfgang says, "I played lock for Marion, for many years. I'm trying to get a team started with the Avar now."
CorNothSergeant		rugby	~kRook says, "I played when I was younger, of course... stand-off, in the academy and for Barloque. I cannot play any more, however, as those hooligans from Marion fractured my spine in a dirty tackle."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Thy karma is much more profoundly effected when thou dost kill another person as to when thou dost kill a beast."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "A large foe like the Lupogg King should only be attacked in sufficient numbers to deal many blows, or thou is doomed indeed."
CorNothSergeant			~kRook says, "Keep this in mind: that when one is attacked with magic, the power of thine weapons and thine armor will protect thee if thy gear be strong enough."
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr says, "I hear more than they think, that's for sure."
MarionBlacksmith			~kColhorr yells, "WHAT WAS THAT?"
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "Mending a weapon with magic reduces the lifespan of that weapon. Put off mends as long as possible."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "Better spellcaster will damage your weapons less when they mend them, but mending is very hard on a weapon's overall life."
JasperBlacksmith			~kQuintor says, "Some creatures, like the scorpion, get a taste for your blood in the fight. They will not rest until you either run and hide or until one of you is dead."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "You cannot show mercy out in the jungle, for none will be shown to you, zax'ix. If your enemy flees, it will only be because they are close to death. Hit them with your range weapons, or they will be back to attack when their strength returns. That is the law of the jungle."
KocatanCaptainEvil			~kXacal says, "Have you heard of the koutom in the tunnels? He is faster than evil itself, I have seen him. Only the most seasoned warrior survives sword-to-sword with that clever moch."
KocatanCaptainGood		koutom	~kCital says, "Koutom is our word for the chieftain of the orcs."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "A piece of advice to the unwary. If you notice that the area is darkening, watch for the teotkriipa, or shadowbeast. They are fast and dangerous."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "I will also warn you that good soldiers survive in the jungle by defending their allies. That works on both sides, for you, and your enemies."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "Beware the avar'ca, even though we are supposedly on neutral standing with them. They are territorial, and will not hesitate to attack if they see you as a threat."
KocatanCaptainGood			~kCital says, "Survival usually depends on knowing your enemy. The primative avar'ca military doctrine usually dictates that they deploy their ranged weapons away from you, the target, while their infantry moves to engage. The best way to combat this is to send part of your force to flank them, and annhilate the archers and spellcasters."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "If you encounter the avar'ca in the jungle, be most careful. They will attack in waves, with the wounded falling back to heal and rally, and then rejoining the fray."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "The stronger a warrior's arms and armor, the better their ability to resist a magical attack. We learned this early on in the a'ach kici'ca, and it will serve you as well. Always take care of your equipment."
KocatanBartender			~kOxal says, "I have heard that in your Land Across and Beneath the Water, you have spirited trees! These tezmecya must make your jungles very difficult to maneuver indeed."
KocatanApothecary			~kZala says, "I don't get it. In your Land Across and Beneath the Water, you have the teotkauilkinich, and you have the little imixkinich. So hey, man, are they the same thing? Do they both come from the kokinich mother? Do they hunt from the same web?"
KocatanTradeMaster		language	~kWulfgang says, "The Meridian language is ugly compared to the language of Ko'catan. In Meridian we say ant, they say ~Iyokinich~I. We say mutant ant, ugh, and they say ~Ikawilkinich~I. Beautiful, isn't it? Odd that such a blunt, war-like people would have such a beautiful way with words."
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "I have heard that in your land you wrap the dead in rags, and then they rise to become napleoc and plague the land! Could this be true? Are you that stupid, zax'nap?"
KocatanShopKeeper			~kPacal says, "Tezotz make your sewers much more perilous to travel than our own, I think... in this city, sewer travel may not be the most ~Iglamorous~I way to get around, but it can be expedient if the occasion necessitates."
KocatanTailor		riija	~kTepal says, "The true follower of Riija will know that the spell strength depends upon the moon phase. The higher the moon, the more powerful will be His spells."
Minstrel		jala	~kParrin says, "Jala bards should find themselves an instrument that they love."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "My liege, I have done the research that you have requested. She is not in touch with the needs of her followers. It may be the key."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "I require reimbursement for my efforts, Akardius. Much of my time was lost doing your work."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "I have scried the counselors meeting, my liege. For the appropriate price, I can tell you their minds with regards to the Princess."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says, "My magic tells me of a new agent of the Bourgeois Castle. When you ascend to the throne, I wish not to be forgotten, my liege."
DarkWizard			~kDuke Akardius says, "Good, Maleval. You will be paid as promised for your information"
DarkWizard			~kDuke Akardius says, "Remember that we have renegotiated the price, Maleval, so you would do well to hold your tongue."
DarkWizard			~kDuke Akardius says, "Maleval, I will remember your station when I become King. You will get what you deserve."
DarkWizard			~kMaleval bows to Duke Akardius.
DarkWizard			~kThe Duke nods to Maleval, "That will be all for now, wizard."

DarkWizard			~kMaleval says to the Duke, "Will there be anything else, my liege?"

DarkWizard			~kPriestess Zuxana says, "~I~rWe shall finish our discussion later, Maleval.~I~k"
DarkWizard			~kMaleval and Priestess Zuxana begin to laugh together.
DarkWizard			~kMaleval says to Priestess Zuxana, "I have ~Ispoken~I with the Duke."
DarkWizard			~kPriestess Zuxana says to the dark wizard, "~I~rIs all going as I planned?~I~k"
DarkWizard			~kMaleval grins, "Zuxana, the one that you spoke of before, is now dead."
DarkWizard			~kSensing that you are listening, Maleval abruptly ends his conversation with the Priestess."
JasperBanker			~kYevitan says, "Both Qor and Shal'ille spell casters will find their abilities heightened the more extreme their karma."
CorNothSergeant		avar	~kRook says, "They are very dangerous, from the tales I have heard. I understand that the Avar can field armies, as we can! I do not think that you will ever see such a force in these parts, though."
CorNothSergeant		dragonfly	~kRook says, "Most remarkable, if what one hears is true! You will not encounter Dragonfly on the Meridian mainland, however. They are confined to Konima's Island."
CorNothSergeant		kriipa	~kRook says, "I have not yet seen this monster, for they live far off in the jungles on Konima's Island."
CorNothSergeant		lupogg king	~kRook says, "There is but one way to attack the Lupogg King, and that is with numbers. Send in different leads to engage him, and pull those warriors back when they become wounded."
CorNothSergeant		orc pitboss orc chieftain	~kRook says, "Only the mightiest warrior should pit their skills against the Orc Pitboss in solo combat, for he is incomprehensibly fast and stronger than two men."
CorNothSergeant		cave orc	~kRook says, "I have not yet encountered a Cave Orc, though you can be sure that they are as formidable as their mountainous counterparts to the south of here."
CorNothSergeant		Shadowbeast	~kRook says, "I have heard that the shadowbeast has the ability to darken the area around itself. I have never seen such a beast, but I know it to be a formidable opponent."
CorNothSergeant		orc shaman	~kRook says, "The Orc Shaman is found in the caves and underground passages of the Orc Warrens. They possess powerful magic, but I cannot say their strength."
JasperBartender		Izzio	~kPietro says, "I ave only seen that man once or twice. He is wandering around.... Know what I mean? He tries to sell that garbage of his."
MarionInnKeeper		Izzio	~kMorrigan says, I am not sure what that fellow is up to. I think he buys and sells goods. I have seen him near the West Merchant way just south of here. Doesn't stay in one place too long though."
TosInnKeeper		Izzio	~kPaddock says, "Go look up by Barloque. He knows better than to show his face in or around Tos."
BarloqueInnKeeper		Izzio	~kPritchett says, "I have seen the man standing right outside the gates. Not by the docks mind you, but the southern side. You can sometimes catch him when you are heading toward the Princess' castle. I have heard though that he moves about."
CorNothInnKeeper		Izzio	~kD'Franco says, "Yea, I've seen him. That sorry excuse for a peddler has been in here. I hope he is not polluting the King's way with his presence again. That man needs to get a real job and stop forcing his wares on the weary travelers coming into town."
Izzio			~kIzzio says, "That is a matter I would need to think on."
Izzio		buy	~kIzzio says, "I wish it weren't so but I have nothing for you today."

Izzio		Jala	~kIzzio says, "Minstrels are the most delightful folk."
Izzio		Riija	~kIzzio says, "Well personally I love a good prank."
Izzio		Faren	~kIzzio says, "Now there is a school worthy of attention.  Faren at least recognizes the power and wonder of nature itself."
Izzio			~kIzzio mumbles, "Twelve minus three, divided by two, carry the one...Oh hello there, beautiful day isn't it?"
Izzio			~kIzzio says, "I hear some talk of beautiful cities, I don't see how they could compare with natures own majesty."
Izzio			~kIzzio whistles happily, although slightly out of tune.
Izzio			~kIzzio perfectly imitates the call of the forest birds.
Izzio			~kIzzio closes his eyes and sighs contentedly, "This is living."

Izzio		Faction Troops	~kIzzio says, "That isn't for me, I like my limbs where they are."
Izzio		Faction	~kIzzio says, "Politics really don't peak my interest."
Izzio		Miriana	~kIzzio says, "You know that I would never seek to offend, but there is something odd about that lass that bears watching.  If I were you, I would keep my eyes and ears open around her."
Izzio		Duke	~kIzzio says, "Poor boy."
