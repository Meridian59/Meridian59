PrincessLiege		necromancers	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Many have told me that they indeed walk the land.  I think we need to find out where and why?"
PrincessLiege		hunters	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "If indeed the necromancers are out there, let us also hope that the hunters are there as well."
PrincessLiege		hunters	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "The story says that Kara'set was the first hunter of this kind. The story also relates that she wielded a magical sword which was taken by Venya'cyr."
PrincessLiege		brax	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "The King always told me Brax is where my families' bloodlines began.  It was my ancestor, Zarrus, who fled that land to settle in Tos."
PrincessLiege		brax	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Of course I have heard the story of how the city fell beneath the earth by the magic of Tendrath.  I believe the exact historical location is somewhat southwest of here."
PrincessLiege		necromancer pendant	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "This hard evidence would surely prove there is more to the old story than I originally thought.  Bring me one of these pendants."
PrincessLiege		sword of the hunt	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "I have heard that their swords contain magical properties particularly potent against those with black souls."
PrincessLiege		necromancer pendant	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Bring me one of these pendants.  It is vital that we have a chance to study such an artifact."
PrincessLiege		venya'cyr	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Well, as the story goes, her reign ended when her entire palace was eaten by the earth.  Legends say that she made a pact to live forever."
PrincessLiege		Zarrus	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Yes he is one of my oldest ancestors.  One rumor states that when he served in the court of Venya'cyr he had the misfortune of touching a vessel of great corruption.  Many of my family believe that we have been cursed from that day forward."
PrincessLiege		Tendrath	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "He is the old mage who caused the city of Brax to be swallowed by the earth.  He also forged the hunter swords.  A sad tale is his."
PrincessLiege		lich	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "The evil forces of the Urn transformed Venya'cyr into a being called the Lich.  The legend says that the Lich can not be killed."
OneCouncilor		lich	~kAlzahakar says, "The lich is the transformed soul of the ancient queen of Brax.  Her name was Venya'cyr.  She was tempted by these ancient forces.  They used her own noble desires to corrupt her."
OneCouncilor		lich	~kAlzahakar says, "I believe that Venya'cyr can never die.  That is the curse.  The more she uses these ancient powers the less of the noble queen survives.  Perhaps by now she is complete in her vileness."
OneCouncilor		Venya'cyr	~kAlzahakar says, "The young princess had a brother.  The brother was King of Brax He was physically deformed and over the years he lost his voice.  The young princess was loved by the people and she performed many of the duties reserved for the king."
OneCouncilor		King of brax	~kAlzahakar says, "A misshapen man whose deformity always made his kingship suspect.  He lived in a time when people believed that the king represented the spirit of a nation.  Are things so different now?  The people did not want to see deformity."
OneCouncilor		brax	~kAlzahakar says, "It was to be the greatest seat of culture that the meridian had ever known.  They were a strong, organized peoples who suffered from self-righteousness and nobility.  Very dangerous for a city."
OneCouncilor		Hunter	~kAlzahakar says, "They are the children of Tendrath the mage.  Their swords give them a great power to wield, but it also demands a sacrifice which might seem brutal to some."
OneCouncilor		hunter 	~kAlzahakar says, "The hunter has sworn eternal vengeance against the necromancers and all those who take the lives of the innocent.  To know that the hunters are on your trail is to know fear."
OneCouncilor		Zarrus	~kAlzahakar says, "Once a nobleman in the House of Brax, he was the cousin of the Princess Venya'cyr.  He fled the realm for Tos when the Ancient forces guiding Venya'cyr pronounced him a rival for the throne."
OneCouncilor		Zarrus	~kAlzahakar says, "Zarrus is an ancestor of the King Zarcos.  Zarrus was a cousin to Venya'cyr.  It takes no genius to figure out that the Lich, at one time, shared the bloodlines of our King.  I am sure she would like it to be thus again."
OneCouncilor		Necromancer pendant	~kAlzahakar says, "The Necromancer Pendant is worn by all who directly serve the Lich.  They are a mouth with which the Lich can feed.  All those who die by the hand of a necromancer feed the hunger of the Lich."
OneCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kAlzahakar says, "Tendrath forged the magical swords to slay the Lich.  The swords were lost to the Lich when the bravest warriors, sent to destroy Venya'cyr, were themselves undone by her power.  The swords are potent against the necromancers but can not kill the Lich."
OneCouncilor		tendrath	~kAlzahakar says, "I know little of him.  His family was killed by Venya'cyr.  It is rumored that his ghost still wanders the land."
TwoCouncilor		lich	~kBei Naq says, "Do I look like a historian to you? I am a simple man, do not ask me about such things."
TwoCouncilor		Venya'cyr	~kBei Naq says, "I have heard the name but I recall nothing about the person."
TwoCouncilor		brax	~kBei Naq says, "A lost city whose treasures, should they be found, could prove very profitable for the one who finds them."
TwoCouncilor		Hunter	~kBei Naq says, "I know nothing of these landless zealots."
TwoCouncilor		Zarrus	~kBei Naq says, "An ancestor of Zarcos.  He began to build the fortune which would later bring his family to power.  I respect his tenacity as well as his methods."
TwoCouncilor		methods	~kBei Naq says, "It is rumored that he was a masterful negotiator who always kept his objectivity.  He was a diplomat for hire who had a knack for easing tension and acquiring wealth.  A potent combination wouldn't you say?"
TwoCouncilor		necromancer pendant	~kBei Naq says, "I would very much like to acquire one of these pendants.  I am sure they would be priceless."
TwoCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kBei Naq says, "I would love to get my hands on one of those swords.  It would certainly be worth a fortune if not priceless."
TwoCouncilor		Tendrath	~kBei Naq says, "Who?"
ThreeCouncilor		lich	~kCylill says, "There was supposedly a fortress built with some ancient magic.  The owner of that fortress was the Lich.  Supposedly the castle had a maze that prevented even the largest forces from entering her realm.  Of course the fear of the Urn probably kept most folk from trying."
ThreeCouncilor		Urn	~kCylill says, "The Urn was the original source of the Lich's power. It was through the forces of the Urn that Queen Venya'cyr was corrupted."
ThreeCouncilor		venya'cyr	~kCylill says, "She was the sister of a impotent king whom all the folk of the land despised. He was a weak minded man with no training in the field and no knowledge of either diplomacy or warfare."
ThreeCouncilor		brax	~kCylill says, "It was to be the greatest military power in the world.  The soldiers of Brax were ferocious warriors and their generals were skilled tacticians."
ThreeCouncilor		hunter	~kCylill says, "I fear men who serve no visible leader.  They are likely to become vigilantes and then I will have to deal with them.  I do not fear them on a personal level, mind you, I fear their lack of guidance or chain of command."
ThreeCouncilor		Zarrus	~kCylill says, "I know not of this man."
ThreeCouncilor		necro pendant	~kCylill says, "People who rely on magics such as this are vulnerable in a way that common folk such as ourselves are not.  It would be wise to investigate the nature of their power."
ThreeCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kCylill says, "Having seen one in use, I am not so sure there is that much difference between the Hunters and the Necromancers."
ThreeCouncilor		Tendrath	~kCylill says, "Tendrath was a weak man who used his power to destroy an entire city."
FourCouncilor		Lich	~kDrechx says, "From what I have heard, the lich can not die.  Her body is transformed by the powers that corrupted her.  I wonder what it is like to live forever?"
FourCouncilor		venya'cyr	~kDrechx says, "A truly despicable character.  She killed her own brother, Ker'toth."
FourCouncilor		brax 	~kDrechx says, "I am no historian.  Talk to the malnourished wizard Alzahakar if you want to know about such things.  Let me ask you this, Have you ever seen that man eat? I have not."
FourCouncilor		hunter	~kDrechx says, "The hunters relationship with her sword seems unhealthy to me.  It is unnatural, and hence it is not good for the body."
FourCouncilor		Zarrus	~kDrechx says, "Nope."
FourCouncilor		Necromancer pendant	~kDrechx says, "The Necromancers pervert all life with their very existence.  The pendant is the culmination of this perversion.  Do you know that the only thing a Necromancer can eat is the life force of the living.  Real food is like poison to it."
FourCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kDrechx says, "Anything that makes the body dependant on foreign material is ultimately bad for the person.  I know these weapons seem to aid the Hunter immensely but I often wonder about the toll it takes on the body."
FourCouncilor		Zarrus	~kDrechx says, "Who?"
FourCouncilor		Necromancer pendant	~kDrechx says, "This is how the Necromancers feed both themselves and their Queen.  It is truly vile.  I know only what Alzahakar tells me."
FourCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kDrechx says, "I hear that it is magical."
FourCouncilor		Tendrath	~kDrechx says, "Isn't he the new vault man in Tos?"
FourCouncilor		Ker'toth	~kDrechx says, "He was deformed, if I remember the story correctly.  The people did not like the fact that their leader was so hunched over and quiet.  The story said that the king lost his voice. How can you have a king with no voice?"
FiveCouncilor		lich	~kEsseldi says, "Ah, you have heard the story of Venya'cyr.  Supposedly the lich can never travel from her cursed city."
FiveCouncilor		Venya'cyr	~kEsseldi says, "Poor girl. She was trapped by the forces surrounding her.  Would you have done any different? Could you have done any different?  Can any of us say we have not succumbed to our darker instincts at some point? It just cost her more than it has the rest of us."
FiveCouncilor		Brax	~kEsseldi says, "Now there is a place I would have liked to see.  Tales of Brax are always about an enlightened civilization aspiring to construct the greatest city of their time.  How brave they must have been, and how foolish."
FiveCouncilor		Hunter	~kEsseldi says, "I have heard of them."
FiveCouncilor		Zarrus	~kEsseldi says, "This is probably not the most popular thing to say but, I think the man was a coward for leaving his city without standing to fight."
FiveCouncilor		necromancer pendant	~kEsseldi says, "I would like to see one of these pendants."
FiveCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kEsseldi says, "I would be interested in seeing one of these swords."
FiveCouncilor		urn	~kEsseldi says, "I remember there was an urn in  the story of Venya'cyr but I do not remember what its significance is."
FarenPriestess		necromancer	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "Their existence is an abomination of nature.  They should be destroyed."
FarenPriestess		Hunter	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "They seem a noble group.  They have vision and a respect for nature that is refreshing. Can they stop the Necromancers? That is the question."
FarenPriestess		Brax	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "An ancient city.  It was destroyed because they ignored the powers of the land.  They chose civilization over nature.  Judge the results for yourself."
FarenPriestess		Venya'cyr	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "If there is one person I could destroy before they were ever born, it would be this abomination."
FarenPriestess		Necromancer pendant	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "They are instruments of death and decay and should be destroyed at the first possible opportunity."
FarenPriestess		sword of the hunt	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "A noble weapon for a noble purpose.  The hunter sword is a magnificent creation.  A admirable representation of a true hero."
FarenPriestess		Zarrus	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "An unremarkable member of the Zarcos lineage, but then, most of their lineage is less than remarkable.  Aristocracy tends to breed with itself. This is not the way of nature."
FarenPriestess		Urn	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "It is the root of this plague of unnatural happenings in the land.  It should be cast into the deepest chasm if not utterly annihilated."
FarenPriestess		tendrath	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "Never before or after has there walked a more righteous man.  All too well I understand his motives and his actions.  He represented all that was decent in that corrupt society."
KraananPriestess		Necromancer	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "The path of the Necromancer is a path of weakness.  A stout warrior should fear nothing about these creatures.  They fall to a sword just as the living do."
KraananPriestess		hunters	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "They are a brave an mighty group.  They are welcome in the house of The Fist."
KraananPriestess		brax	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "The warriors of Brax were undisciplined and lazy.  Because of that, they lost their city."
KraananPriestess		Venya'cyr	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "She got what she deserved."
KraananPriestess		necromancer pendant	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "It is often the way for weaker beings to enhance their abilities with magical baubles.  Of course the necromancers need such things."
KraananPriestess		sword of the hunt	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "A useful weapon.  I consider it dangerous to rely on such things for success in combat."
KraananPriestess		Zarrus	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "What is your opinion of a man who leaves his country in its darkest hour to save himself."
KraananPriestess		tendrath	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "What do you want me say?  He was an old man who used magic. I know nothing else."
QorPriestess		Brax	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "An old city destroyed by the chaotic and unpredictable forces of nature.  How can so many trust those forces now and believe that they will guide them to salvation?  Nature cares little for the deeds or thoughts of humanity."
QorPriestess		Venya'cyr	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "Poor thing."
QorPriestess		Necromancer pendant	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "It is an interesting artifact. I am certain that if I had time to study one of them I could enlighten all of us with its exact composition and abilities.  Unfortunately, I have no one to bring me one of these pendants. Shame."
QorPriestess		sword of the hunt	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "Everyone seems to just accept these Hunters for what they are.  I see a group of killers, stalking humans with the permission of our government.  What sort of society do we live in?  I see terrible hypocrisy in this. What is the difference between the Hunters and the Necromancers?  One of these groups has a good connection with our leader."
QorPriestess		Zarrus	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "The problems of our society can be traced back to this man and his deeds.  When times got hard for him he turned his tail and fled.  It is because of his juvenile fears that prejudice has been allowed to destroy many schools of thought.  This is your world.  Is this how you would have things?"
QorPriestess		The urn	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "I have begun to study ancient relics in order to better understand the world we have evolved from.  You could say I collect such things.  I would pay a fair price for this old fossil.  At very least it may prove a interesting new ornament for the temple."
QorPriestess		Tendrath	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "I feel sorry for him.  Venya'cyr goes insane, kills his family, and he starts to fiddle with the chaotic powers of nature.  He was a tool.  I am sure his intentions were noble but the fact of the matter is he dealt in forces that he could not control and destroyed an entire city.  Because of him we have lost a culture."
ShalillePriestess		Necromancers	~kPriestes Xiana says, "There are no redeeming qualities in these creatures.  There is no mercy or humanity in them. They exist to take life.  They are completely blind to the ways Of Shal'ille."
ShalillePriestess		Hunter	~kPriestes Xiana says, "Killing people is wrong, no matter how justified the reasons may be.  There must be a solution to our problems that does not involve the spilling of blood."
ShalillePriestess		brax	~kPriestes Xiana says, "They were a people without the guidance of Shal'ille."
ShalillePriestess		VENYA'CYR	~kPriestes Xiana says, "Without faith in the harmony of all things, we are all more likely to turn towards that which promises the easy solution.  Venya'cyr took the easy path to her desires and it cost her eternal soul."
ShalillePriestess		Necromancer pendant	~kPriestes Xiana says, "These things should not even be touched.  Their ability to corrupt is almost instantaneous and irreversible. Leave their destruction to the higher powers."
ShalillePriestess		sword of the hunt	~kPriestes Xiana says, "What is the difference between the  poisonous snake and the constrictor? Stay clear of all things related to the Hunters' work."
ShalillePriestess		Zarrus	~kPriestes Xiana says, "If he had not survived, the course of history would surely be different."
ShalillePriestess		Tendrath	~kPriestes Xiana says, "I pray for his soul every time I think of his tragedy."
RiijaMonk		necromancer	~kRiija Monk says, "There is a parasite that lives inside me.  To kill the parasite I must kill myself."
RiijaMonk		hunter	~kRiija Monk says, "Once upon a time, the prince and the princess lived happily ever after."
RiijaMonk		brax	~kRiija Monk says, "If the base of your house is made of air, it will surely topple."
RiijaMonk		Venya'cyr	~kRiija Monk says, "She was a man."
RiijaMonk		Necromancer pendant	~kRiija Monk says, "Imagine always eating but never getting full."
RiijaMonk		sword of the hunt	~kRiija Monk says, "What did you say, the hunger sword?"
RiijaMonk		Zarrus	~kRiija Monk says, "The real Zarrus died in Brax."
RiijaMonk		tendrath	~kRiija Monk says, "When the Prince dies before the King, it is a day to weep."
DarkWizard		Necromancer	~kMaleval says, "They are proof that things are not so neat as the priestesses would have you believe. Of course there are other forces of immense power in our world."
DarkWizard		Hunter	~kMaleval says, "They will be no match for the dark forces which they supposedly hunt.  Their undoing will be their swords."
DarkWizard		Brax	~kMaleval says, "I remember the people of Brax as very industrious... perhaps too narrow in their vision... or perhaps merely very unlucky."
DarkWizard		Venya'cyr	~kMaleval says, "She was a child when she encountered one of the most powerful forces in the universe.  When the Ancient one opened his eyes and saw her, her soul became a toy."
DarkWizard		Lich	~kMaleval says, "The lich is the first incarnation of the Ancient One in this realm.  It is a child of darkness that will bring others to this land. It is a messenger of doom for this world.  The Ancient One has been awakened."
DarkWizard		Necro pendant	~kMaleval says, "A toy for children who wish to live forever and lose their soul.  A truly remarkable invention."
DarkWizard		sword of the hunt	~kMaleval says, "Please entertain the notion that the hunters and the necromancers serve the same function.  Their methods and ideologies may be separate, but make no mistake, they both eat souls."
DarkWizard		Zarrus	~kMaleval says, "You must give the man credit for escaping the destruction of his homeland.  He was a shameless survivor."
DarkWizard		Urn	~kMaleval says, "The Ancient One, long ago, created instruments through which it could manipulate the environment.  This is done to prepare the way for its rebirth. The urn is one such instrument."
DarkWizard		Ancient one	~kMaleval says, "Why don't you ask the priestesses about them.  I would be interested to hear their response."
DarkWizard		ancient ones	~kMaleval says, "Please, do not demean your intellect by believing that the only powers in our world are those of some glorified heroes."
MarionElder		Brax	~kRan er'Hoth says, "An old city, destroyed by the foolish desires of a child."
MarionElder		Lich	~kRan er'Hoth says, "It is rumored that this creature can not die.  Which poses a great obstacle for those who would see it's dark reign thwarted."
MarionElder		Necromancer	~kRan er'Hoth says, "These are the dirty teeth which feed the mouth that can not be satiated.  They serve only the Lich and it's nefarious designs."
MarionElder		Necromancer pendant	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Do not touch these things!  Even the slightest contact with them could be harmful to those who are still among the living."
MarionElder		Hunter	~kRan er'Hoth says, "They are killers.  The question then becomes, 'Is there a place for justified vigilantes in our land?'  My answer is yes."
MarionElder		sword of the hunt	~kRan er'Hoth says, "They eat souls."
MarionElder		Venya'cyr	~kRan er'Hoth says, "I have no tolerance or pity for her.  She made decisions that have hurt thousands of people.  Her mistake is still costing you and I today.  And what have we learned?  What good has come from her deeds?  It is too bad she was not destroyed a thousand years ago."
MarionElder		Tendrath	~kRan er'Hoth says, "In his situation, I would have done the same things he did.  It is rumored that the spirit of this man still roams the world beneath the earth.  Seek him out and you will find answers to many questions."
Heretic		Lich	~kMiriana says, "The Lich is the hungry mouth of a child that feeds the mother.  The mother sleeps while the child feeds her.  Ha! Imagine that.  Shhhh."
Heretic		Brax	~kMiriana says, "Brax, Brax, Brax, you will never get the facts."
Heretic		Necromancer	~kMiriana says, "I have seen them. They remind me of crows.  I tried to make one some soup and he and he started to cry."
Heretic		Necromancer pendant	~kMiriana says, "Oh pretty, pretty necklace! Ouch!  Hey, leave my soul alone, pretty necklace.  I just want... I just want to... I just want to look pretty too."
Heretic		Hunter	~kMiriana says, "What do they do with their catches, these hunters?  Do they eat their catches?  Do they make coats out of their hides?  Do they put their stuffed heads in a room? I am just wondering."
Heretic		sword of the hunt	~kMiriana says, "The swords are as dangerous as their prey."
Heretic		Venya'cyr	~kMiriana says, "The dreams of children.  The dreams of children can be very dangerous. I wonder if she knows about my dreams."
Heretic		Tendrath	~kMiriana says, "He is still around somewhere. I saw him.  Where did I see him?  I can not remember."
JasperElder		Brax	~kAfiera D'xor says, "We have much to learn from the mistakes of the past.  Brax was a terrible mistake, but what have we learned?"
JasperElder		Lich	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Eventually there will come a point when we will have to deal with the Lich in battle.  The time is now to find out about your enemy."
JasperElder		Necromancer	~kAfiera D'xor says, "The pendant is a point of power for the necromancer.  It is also a point of vulnerability.  Understand this and perhaps they can be overcome. Make no mistake, they intend to overcome us."
JasperElder		Necromancer 	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Destroy them at all costs."
JasperElder		hunter 	~kAfiera D'xor says, "They are little better than the Necromancers, if you ask me."
JasperElder		sword of the hunt	~kAfiera D'xor says, "It is a tool of death.  Let us hope these Hunters have at least a shred of moral fiber."
JasperElder		Venya'cyr	~kAfiera D'xor says, "What of her?"
JasperElder		Tendrath	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I wish the poor man had achieved his goal all those years ago.  Then we would not have to deal with these tribulations today."
HunterGhost		Necromancer	~kTendrath says, "They must be destroyed at all costs!  Those vile monsters crave nothing but total consumption of all life forces here in Meridian.  They are the pathetic pawns of their queen.  If you destroy them you weaken the Lich.  If you defeat the Lich the necromancers will be destroyed.  Of course, Venya'cyr can never be killed.  You must find a way to contain her infectious power.  Defeating her gives you a temporary respite, but we are all fated to watch her rise again."
HunterGhost		Venya'cyr	~kTendrath says, "I was told longer after my eldest son's murder that it was, indeed, the Three of the Urn who first brought my name to the ears of Venya'cyr.  Her spirit was so foul.  Upon the words of demons she sent those men to my house!  To ensure her own immortality, she destroyed the bloodline that was my family.  She murdered my son, thinking it was me.  I was a simple man.  I would have suffered many things for our leader.  I asked for none of this.  But now... Now I will never rest until I see that creature gone from this world forever."
HunterGhost		Lich	~kTendrath says, "The Lich is the first manifestation of an ancient presence within this world.  There is a story of a creature, older than the world, that sleeps within it.  I believe the Lich's powers springs from this creature.  I understand that you have many gods.  It would be best if these beings aided us now.  Let us hope they listen to your prayers.  Whether they do or not, you can be assured that I will never rest until she is gone. I have learned not to count on the gods."
HunterGhost		Hunter	~kTendrath says, "Upon being buried under ground, I found that my spirit did not depart this world as I would have thought.  For many years I could not comprehend the reason for this.  I existed only with my grief and my loneliness.  Then, slowly, the rocks began to move and I saw that the Lich was not dead.  She certainly was in no way human any more.  I knew then, why I had not left this place.  My task was not complete."
HunterGhost		sword of the hunt	~kTendrath says, "While the army lay siege to Brax, I spent weeks calling the magic of the earth.  Never before had I used my magic on weapons.  But I transformed the swords of the most brave into instruments of destruction.  The spirit of the sword was linked to its owner.  The link was strongest when they sought vengeance.  The swords deliver retribution."
HunterGhost		Necro pendant	~kTendrath says, "I have only seen pendants on the rotting corpses of the Lich's minions.  Their magic is strange and foreign.  It is not the power of death that they hold.  Death is a natural thing.  Pendants are the vein which transform life into UNDEATH."
HunterGhost		Brax	~kTendrath says, "It was my city.  I am told that the people of Brax are no more.  That the purity of our people has been mingled with the blood of inferiors.  What is there to say?  Shall I tell you of how each person in Brax was born with magic within them.  That each persons' magic was unique.  That their character's were strong and honest.  They are no more and to speak of them gives me great pain."
HunterGhost		Underground caves	~kTendrath says, "When Kara'set was slain by the lich, all was lost.  Our greatest warrior was defeated.  The army had suffered many losses and retreated.  We had lost the swords within the walls of Brax.  The murderer of my son would go unpunished.  I sat alone.  I heard a sound and looked around.  A small animal was running into a large fissure in the ground.  Inside that fissure I found caves that led deep into the ground.  For days I traveled.  A huge cavern lay beneath our city.  There were ancient artifacts there from some forgotten people.  It was then that I knew what to do."
HunterGhost		Kara Set	~kTendrath says, "She was the most ferocious warrior Brax ever had.  She was Venya'cyr's close friend.  When Venya'cyr murdered the King, her own brother, Kara'set knew that her friend was no more. I personally saw Kara'set slay nearly three score necromancers on her way towards the palace and the Lich.  If anyone ever had the magic to kill the Lich it was her.  To face such things the soul must be pure.  Within Kara'set, the Lich saw a blemish.  Deep within the warrior there was guilt."
HunterGhost		guilt	~kTendrath says, "Before the King was murdered by Venya'cyr.  Kara'set had come to the princess and voiced her disapproval of the King.  There were certain military groups that felt his deformity could give their enemies the idea that the country was weak.  I know it sounds foolish.  You must understand the people of Brax to understand why Kara'set felt this way.  In some way Kara'set felt like she helped convince her closest friend to murder her brother."
HunterGhost		deformity	~kTendrath says, "The King of Brax had a curved spine and towards the end of his reign, had no voice whatsoever."
HunterGhost		urn	~kTendrath says, "I know little of the Urn. I have never seen it.  I know only that it was uncovered by a craftsman working on the foundation of the new palace. Within the Urn lurk the Three of the Urn."
HunterGhost		three of the Urn	~kTendrath says, "These devilish beings are but shadows that plague the living and coax them towards their own dark designs."
HunterGhost		Ker'Toth	~kTendrath says, "He was my King.  His sister murdered him.  His sister was Venya'cyr.  It was the powers of the Urn that originally corrupted the soul of the young princess.  It was this power which enabled the princess to sacrifice her own brother and leave a people without a leader."
HunterGhost		Nexus	~kTendrath says, "My grandfather remembers the Nexus.  It was a portal.  King Fahr'nohl would travel through the Nexus.  He brought many fine things to our world but I am sure he also brought many things that were dangerous.  When the Nexus disappeared, Fahr'nohl was finished. His power lay in his ability to travel the nexus and return.  His majesty faded and Castle Victoria was all but abandoned."
HunterGhost		FAhr Nohl	~kTendrath says, "He was the last man to travel the Nexus.  His authority and influence with the people came from his link to the Nexus.
