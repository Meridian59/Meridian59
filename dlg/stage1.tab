Heretic			~kMiriana giggles disdainfully, "You couldn't hear it's call could you?  Poor little thing." 
Heretic			~kMiriana dances around playfully, "Power runs in, power flows out.  Power flows in, power runs out."
Heretic		hello	~kMiriana takes a menacing step towards you, "Was it you?  Did you try to steal the power?  Oh of course not, silly me."
Heretic			~kMiriana says, "Resurrection is eminent, just wait and see."
Heretic			~kMiriana whispers, "Did it call to you too?  It's so pretty all swirly, and swishy like."
Heretic			~kMiriana dances in a circle and abruptly falls down, "The voice won't let me be, it's all fuzzy, but it won't ever go away.  Make it go away."
Heretic		attack	~kMiriana looks at you sadly, "Poor little node never hurt anyone, no it didn't.  It didn't want anyone to hurt it, it never hurt anyone."
Heretic			~kMiriana jumps up and down, eyes flashing, "Did you see the big monsters that went boom and bang, and had the pretty middle thing?  Oh look out there's one behind you!"
Heretic			~kMiriana suddenly shrinks within herself, "The Gods aren't happy, oh no.  They aren't happy about this at all."
Heretic			~kMiriana plucks at her dress, "I wonder if she would make me a pretty new dress with some of her thread.  Do you think she will?"
Heretic			~kMiriana yells suddenly, "Take, take, take, that's all you ever do.  I want something now too."
Heretic			~kMiriana sings softly, "~IHave you heard the true tale of the gods, have you heard of the fall of the one~I."
Heretic		venya'cyr	~kMiriana giggles, "Her death was her downfall in more ways than one."
Heretic			~kMiriana says, "I wonder, do you think the Gods feel guilty over their lies?" 
Heretic			~kMiriana stares into the sun, "Sometimes the light that guides us is too strong and you are engulfed within it."
Heretic			~kMiriana says, "You know Hester could help you, she helped me once...or was that someone else.  Hum..."
Heretic			~kMiriana looks around frightfully, then runs off into the trees.
Heretic			~kMiriana yells, "No, no, NO! Mean, mean, MEAN!! Won't, won't, WON'T!!!"
Heretic			~kMiriana's eyes shine brightly with tears, "Did you see it break? I did. It was so empty, and dull, and sad. I don't like being sad it makes me cry."

Izzio		Node attack	~kIzzio seems to ponder, "I've been thinkin about that, and the one thing that bothers me is that Miriana always seems to be there before anyone else. Now I know she's a saying that the nodes are calling her, but doesn't it seem a bit odd to you?"
Izzio		god	~kIzzio says, "I'm not sure what you are getting at with that comment, but I'll tell you right now it's dangerous ground."
Izzio		fates	~kIzzio says, "Try talking to Hester Gilk about it, she might be able to tell you more."
