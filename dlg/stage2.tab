Heretic		Node attack	~kMiriana says, "You wish to stop me? Then perhaps you should look to your trusted advisors, the councilors, for the answer."
Heretic		Node attack	~kMiriana says, "Do you wish to know what the power is for? Is that what you are asking little bird?"
Heretic		Node attack	~kMiriana's eyes gleam brightly, "Do you want the power back? Do you wish to try and take it from me? Poor little birds, running around without their little nodes."
Heretic		hello	~kMiriana says, "Hello, do you wish to play with me? I can call all my friends and we could play tag! Tag, you're it!"
Heretic		hello	~kMiriana says, "Why hello there, and who is the master that sent you this time?"
Heretic		hello	~kMiriana glares at you intently, "And just ~Iwhat~I do you mean by that?"
Heretic			~kMiriana whispers to the wind, "Any day now, any day and they will see the truth and you shall be free to walk upon the land, yes you will."
Heretic			~kMiriana dances gleefully, "It was me, me do you hear? I stole the power, and it is mine."
Heretic		councilors	~kMiriana says, "Not all things are as they seem, if you wish to learn the truth about them you might try talking to Madelia."
Heretic		councilors	~kMiriana says, "Run away tokens, run away from the bad men."
Heretic		councilors	~kMiriana shrieks shrilly, "Bad, bad, bad men. It's all because of them. They know, they know what they are doing, do you?"
Heretic		hester gilk	~kMiriana smiles, "She uses pretty thread to weave her wares, such pretty thread. I hope she makes me something pretty too."
Heretic		venya'cyr	~kMiriana looks thoughtful, "Cut the thread, snip snip.  Measure the thread, cut the thread, snip snip. I wonder if she ever tires of that?"
Heretic		weave	~kMiriana giggles, "Not me silly bird, I don't look like Hester Gilk...Do I?."
Heretic		cut	~kMiriana sighs, "Now how can you mistake ~Ime~I for a Lich."
Heretic			~kMiriana screams, "Go away! I don't cut the thread, don't make me. GO AWAY!!"
Heretic			~kMiriana abruptly sits down and huffs, "Spin, spin, spin, that's all I do. Makes me dizzy sometimes. Well it would make you dizzy too."
Heretic			~kMiriana dances around in a circle, "Time, time soon it will be time. Then they will all see. They won't doubt me anymore."
Heretic			~kMiriana looks down at her feet, "Have I been bad? I didn't mean to be bad. I only did what I ~Bhad~B to do, you understand don't you?"
Heretic		madelia	~kMiriana says, "She believes me, she knows, but I don't know how she knows. She knows, ask her she will tell you."
Heretic			~kMiriana suddenly takes a menacing step towards you and you realize that approaching her would be tantamount to suicide.
Heretic			~kMiriana growls fiercely, then slaps a hand over her mouth, "My goodness now ~Iwhere~I did that come from? Did that come from you? Did ~Iyou~I give it to me?"
Heretic			~kMiriana taps you on the shoulder, looking innocent, "Excuse me, but did you want to kill that huge monster looming over your shoulder?"
Heretic			~kMiriana cry's softly, "You believe me don't you? This isn't the way it was to go. You little birds can still stop it, but first you must seek the truth. Can you do that little bird? Can you hear the truth?"
CorNothTailor		miriana	~kHester Gilk says, "Poor dear, it's really not fair that she takes that sort of abuse for her beliefs."
CorNothTailor		miriana	~kHester Gilk says, "Why do you think that the priestess are so afraid of the child? Think on that then return to me."
CorNothTailor		miriana	~kHester Gilk says, "The yarn she spins was quite jumbled, she is only now smoothing out the tangles."
CorNothTailor		Node attack	~kHester Gilk says, "Have you delved into the reasons behind her actions? You might be surprised at the answers."
CorNothTailor		Node attack	~kHester Gilk says, "Is it the power or her actions that you wish to learn more about? Either or I am not the one to teach you. You might wish to seek out those in positions of authority, they might be able to tell you more."
CorNothTailor		Node attack	~kHester Gilk says, "Attention is drawn to those who are most desperate to change things."
CorNothTailor		councilors	~kHester Gilk says, "A change is most certainly in order, this system of government that we see now is dated and worn. Their power is waning, and what they might do to augment that is worse than you could imagine."
CorNothTailor		councilors	~kHester Gilk says, "Nonsense, what gives them the right to think they can govern the people better than the people. Arrogant players in a game that is not of their own creating. They fear the change that is coming mark my words."
CorNothTailor		gods	~kHester Gilk says, "Always keep in your mind that history is written by the victors. If the present Gods were the victors what tale do you suppose they would wish to keep hidden?"
CorNothTailor		god	~kHester Gilk says, "Who can say what else lies beyond the boundaries of what is known. The great libraries do not hold all the keys. Can you even guess as it to what is not told to us in those histories?"
CorNothTailor		weave	~kHester Gilk smiles, and you feel there is something she is not telling you, "Would you care to see some of my weavings? You never know what you might discover, maybe even something about yourself that you didn't even know."
CorNothTailor		cut	~kHester Gilk says, "I send my thread to be cut by another. Weaving is my trade, the cutting of the thread is best left to another, someone more, suitable."
CorNothTailor		venya'cyr	~kHester Gilk says, "Strange is it not, that the moment of her death, which seems to most to be her most triumphant moment, was actually her weakest one?"
CorNothTailor		fates	~kHester Gilk gets a strange look in her eyes, "Hum, and just what do ~Iyou~I know of the fates dear child?"
Lich		Node attack	~kVenya'Cyr gets a most bloodthirsty look in her eyes, "Such a delicious situation. Such blood, death, and chaos. I only wonder why the child hasn't done this before."
Lich		Node attack	~kVenya'Cyr says, "Why should the loss of one or two bother you so? Join into the ranks of my necromancers and you shall not be bothered by such trivial notions. We shall cut the threads of the lives of those who oppose us.
Lich		Node attack	~kVenya'Cyr says, "Would you like me to suck your life force from you as Miriana sucked the power from the nodes?"
Lich		miriana	~kVenya'Cyr says, "The child has guidance, if you cannot stomach the violent nature of that guidance then don't inquire as to it."
Lich		miriana	~kVenya'Cyr says, "Our time has come, those who do not accept the truth shall be destroyed."
Lich		miriana	~kVenya'Cyr says, "Who do you side with? Is it your time to live, or your time to ~rdie~k?"
Lich		fates	~kVenya'Cyr gets an odd gleam in her eyes, "Would you care to join them?"
Izzio		god	
Izzio		miriana	~kIzzio sighs, "I gave as much warning as I could, those who discarded those warnings can only blame themselves."
Izzio		miriana	~kIzzio gives you an odd look, "You are not one with nature, I shall not answer any more of your queries."
Izzio		miriana	~kIzzio says, "Nature does not lie, and nature did not lie to me about Miriana's true intentions."
Izzio		Node attack	~kIzzio says, "Do you wish to see the land destroyed? If not then you will find a way to stop Miriana and her plans."
Izzio		Node attack	~kIzzio says, "Mother, things just do not add up. Is the child evil, or just protecting something else from evil?"
Izzio		Node attack	~kIzzio says, "Don't get me wrong, I do think that the child is a threat, although I'm not sure that she is the greatest threat to the land."
Izzio		hester gilk	~kIzzio says, "Hum, strange, but there is more to that old woman than she lets on. Her ties to all of this still allude me, but she is involved somehow."
TosInnKeeper		miriana	~kPaddock says, "What else can you expect from someone who has been thrown out from society and lived amongst the wilds for so long? She has no concept of civilization, therefore she tries to destroy it."
TosInnKeeper		miriana	~kPaddock yells, "Get out of my bar, you power greedy, troll monger!"
TosInnKeeper		Node attack	~kPaddock says, "I've heard that the nodes power restores itself after time, like it's refilling from some great reservoir or something."
TosInnKeeper		Node attack	~kPaddock shrugs, "The councilors tell us she is dangerous and must be destroyed, I guess we just have to believe them don't we."
TosInnKeeper		Node attack	~kPaddock says, "I've had about enough of your comments, all this dreariness is bad for business. Drink up or get out."
TosInnKeeper		miriana	~kPaddock says, "Maybe she's just starved for attention, and this is her way of getting it."
TosInnKeeper		fates	~kPaddock says, "I think I've heard rumors of something like that, isn't that like the Spinner, the weaver, and the cutter. Oh well it's just an old wives tales, pay no attention to it at all."
BarloqueInnKeeper		miriana	~kPrichett says, "Me thinketh that you better leaveth this Inn, that nameth is not welcome hereth."
BarloqueInnKeeper		Node attack	~kPrichett says, "I hath heardeth that Miriana calls forth great monsters of the elements, but sucheth tales musteth be exaggerated."
BarloqueInnKeeper		Node attack	~kPrichett says, "I hath never witnessed sucheth an event, but some of mith customers claimeth they haveth."
BarloqueInnKeeper		Node attack	~kPrichett says, "Why wouldeth anyone wish to draineth the power of our sacred nodes? I wondreth..."
BarloqueInnKeeper		miriana	~kPrichett says, "I still can noth comprehendeth where a child wouldeth obtain such powers and knowledge. 'Tis something that maketh one think."
BarloqueInnKeeper		miriana	~kPrichett says, "Have thee seeneth this child of destruction?"
BarloqueInnKeeper		fates	~kPrichett says, "Thou dost listen to too many rumors, everbody knowth that it'th just myth and legend."
BarloqueBartender		miriana	~kMeidei says, "Speak not the foul name of that accursed presence here, she seeks to tarnish the name of our Lady Shal'ille."
BarloqueBartender		Node attack	~kMeidei says, "Thy must have faith in the knowledge that should Miriana become a threat that our Lady Shal'ille shall take care to protect us, I know that I do."
BarloqueBartender		Node attack	~kMeidei says, "Does thy wonder ever just what a child would need with power of that sort?"
BarloqueBartender		Node attack	~kMeidei says, "Let us speak of these events no more, we shall break bread and pray to Lady Shal'ille for guidance."
BarloqueBartender		miriana	~kMeidei says, "She doth draw attention to herself, one must wonder for what purpose she would have need of such."
BarloqueBartender		miriana	~kMeidei says, "Lady Shal'ille guide us to the path of peace, for destruction can only lead to more destruction. I fear greatly this call for her demise, for surely causing the demise of another would lead to one's own demise."
BarloqueBartender		fates	~kMeidei says, "To utter such nonsense could verily get you into much trouble."
CorNothInnKeeper		miriana	~kD'Franco says, "I hear tell of the things she says, she is surely mad. Do not bring such madness into my establishment, lest it be catching."
CorNothInnKeeper		Node attack	~kD'Franco says, "I have wondered just what cause is behind Miriana's actions.  Could it be madness? Could it be loneliness? Or could it be something that we never had wish to consider?"
CorNothInnKeeper		Node attack	~kD'Franco shudders, "Those creatures that Miriana calls to her, I wonder could they be her only friends? Wouldn't that be sad."
CorNothInnKeeper		Node attack	~kD'Franco says, "I don't have the time to talk to you. Go talk to Hester Gilk, she surely knows more than she lets on, perhaps she can tell you more about what you want to know."
CorNothInnKeeper		miriana	~kD'Franco says, "I have faith that the good Duke hath plans to rid us of her menace, but still in the name of scholarship I can't but help consider the implications behind it."
CorNothInnKeeper		miriana	~kD'Franco says, "I must admit that the thought of all that power in her hands makes me quite nervous, in fact it gives me chills to think of what she could do with it all. I have no question that she could even level a whole town, if her will do directed it."
CorNothInnKeeper		fates	~kD'Franco says, "I have heard tales, but tales only, that there is a power which was split into three faces, so that balance was given unto to the power. The tale also says that the power would have to find keepers in order for it to physically manifest itself to others. The tale was old, and not much is remembered anymore. That is all I can tell you of it."
MarionInnKeeper		miriana	~kMorrigan's face turns a bright red, and he looks as if he might explode, "EXCUSE ME PLEASE!!!"
MarionInnKeeper		Node attack	~kMorrigan says, "It's quite extraordinary, what Miriana has done. Not that I abide by it at all, cause I don't, but how she has drained the nodes like that. I mean did anyone else know that it was possible, I didn't know it was possible, and Tova says he didn't know it was possible, and Tova knows everything. Did you know it was possible? Yes quite extraordinary, ~bPOP~k, all gone, just like that no more..."
MarionInnKeeper		Node attack	~kMorrigan says, "Oh I'm sorry were you linked to one of the nodes that Miriana took, or one she tried to take? Was it painful? Did it make your head feel like it was being squished? Did you fall over in your soup like someone hit you in the back of the head? Did you try to protect the node? NO, oh no don't hit me I'm sorry!"
MarionInnKeeper		Node attack	~kMorrigan rubs his hands together and looks quite peevish for a moment, "Ppp-ooooowwwerr...all that power....so much power. Oh, I'm sorry didn't see you standing there, can I help you with something? Did you need a room?"
MarionInnKeeper		miriana	~kMorrigan says, "I do wonder how she came to be all alone in the forest like that, I mean isn't that a bit odd, what parent would just leave their child dancing in a forest all alone like that? Would you leave your child dancing all alone in a forest like that?"
MarionInnKeeper		miriana	~kMorrigan bobs his head up and down so much you are afraid it might fall off, "Ran'er Hoth swears that she is older than old, but how come she still looks like a little girl, and acts like a little girl... Well sometimes she does, but how can someone stay like that forever? Haven't you ever thought about how odd that is, or what could be the reason the is like that?"
MarionInnKeeper		fates	~kMorrigan says, "Oh yes, that's that game that Meidei runs from his bar sometimes isn't it? Oh, it isn't hum, well I don't know what you are talking about then."
MarionBartender		miriana	~kTova says, "She's a menace plain and simple, no other way about it, no matter what anyone else might say."
MarionBartender		Node attack	~kTova says, "What's as full as it can be, but not as it could be? Your mana after you tangle with Miriana! Hah, haha..."
MarionBartender		Node attack	~kTova says, "What's paler than pale? Your face after you see one of Miriana's creatures. HAH!"
MarionBartender		Node attack	~kTova looks you over, "You have a tangle or two with Miriana and 'er creatures or something? You look like death warmed over."
MarionBartender		miriana	~kTova says, "What's 2 inches tall that noone can see? Miriana's God!"
MarionBartender		miriana	~kTova says, "All jokes aside, I wish someone would do something about that girl, can't help but get the creeps when I start thinking about all the things she could do with all that power."
MarionBartender		fates	~kTova says, "Ah fate, yes fate plays a role in all of our lives. It is into that which we fall from birth."
JasperInnKeeper		miriana	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Get out before you bring bad omen's into my Inn. Come on out with ya, shoo!"
JasperInnKeeper		Node attack	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "She says we should look the  councilors for answers, heh, just between you and me, I never did trust them too slick buggers. I always thought they were hiding something."
JasperInnKeeper		Node attack	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "Us mountain folk learn to live without all of them little extras, something gets taken away, we do without. In some ways it kinda funny to see all of them running around with their britches on fire trying to get the nodes back."
JasperInnKeeper		Node attack	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "'Taint no concern of mine."
JasperInnKeeper		miriana	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "She's just a sad little girl that noone will listen too. What would you do when pushed to far?"
JasperInnKeeper		miriana	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "I just wonder what would happen if she really were telling the truth.  Would it matter to anyone?"
JasperInnKeeper		fates	~kThe Widow Qesino says, "What are you talking about?"
JasperBartender		miriana	~kPietro says, "Get, ~IHic~I, outz my bar, and, ~IHic~I, mind your onz damned buzinez!"
JasperBartender		Node attack	~kPietro says, "From what I hear, she ain't drainin them nodez dry, shez just taking a wee bit, an' it just takz a bit to refill it like."
JasperBartender		Node attack	~kPietro says, "Peoplz all frettin like, an itz o'er a child. What could a little child be doin so bad?"
JasperBartender		Node attack	~kPietro says, "~IHic~I, stikin, good fer nothin schildren. Alwaz dirt'n diaperz, schan't truzt 'em alone wit nuttin."
JasperBartender		miriana	~kPietro says, "Rumor haz it dat she's not talkin bout a God, but shez talkin bout her own self 'stead."
JasperBartender		miriana	~kPietro says, "She just a little girl an' everybody knows that children don't know nothing."
JasperBartender		fates	~kPietro mumbles, "Ged fer nuttin idoitz, when life handz 'em a bad hand havin to go blame fate and not themselvz."
QorPriestess		miriana	~kZuxana says, "~I~rThe impudent wench, even I must admit she has gone too far. She must be destroyed, as a servant of Qor it is demanded of you to carry out his will.~n~k"
QorPriestess		miriana	~kZuxana smiles sensuously, "~I~rThere now, do not concern yourself with her and her obvious lies. She shall be dealt with in good time.~n~k"
QorPriestess		miriana	~kZuxana says, "~I~rYes, of course she must be destroyed. Let her spread her little tales, she cannot harm the truth.~n~k"
KraananPriestess		miriana	~kQuerti'nya says, "~B~bThis demon must be stopped before she not only destroys the land but the very beliefs with which our foundations are built upon. Her lies are not fit for the ears of true believers.~n~k"
KraananPriestess		miriana	~kQuerti'nya says, "~B~bKraanan's fist shall be the justice served to her evil deceptive ways.~n~k"
KraananPriestess		miriana	~kQuerti'nya says, "~B~bShe wishes to make of herself a God, her arrogance and deception shall not be tolerated within this holy temple of justice. Her demise shall be quick and painless, yet necessary.~n~k"
FarenPriestess		miriana	~kTenuv'vyal screams at the top of her lungs, and you wonder if she might finally have been pushed over the edge of sanity.
FarenPriestess		miriana	~kTenuv'vyal laughs harshly, "~B~gPeople call me mad, don't deny it I know they do. What do they name this creature of chaos and lies, sane?~n~k"
FarenPriestess		miriana	~kTenuv'vyal says, "~B~gDESTROY HER! TAKE HER LIES AND CHAOS FROM THE LAND!! IT IS THE ONLY WAY!!! DO IT, DO IT NOW!!!!~n~k"
ShalillePriestess		miriana	~kXiana says, "~bLady Shal'ille doth see the need for her demise, and although she hath shed her tears for the violence of the action she knows it is the only way to free ourselves of Miriana's madness.~k"
ShalillePriestess		miriana	~kXiana says, "~bTake my hands, we shall pray to Shal'ille to give us the strength to do what is necessary, what is right.~k"
ShalillePriestess		miriana	~kXiana says, "~bUnfortunatly we might have all misjudged Tenuv'vyals premonitions as those of paranoid ramblings. Now that Miriana has shown her true intentions we now know that Tenuv'vyal was not paranoid enough.~k"
RiijaMonk		miriana	~kThe Monk of Riija seems to shrug, "~BTruth, ~I~rlies~I, ~gthe ~bonly ~I~gdifference is~I ~B~rin perception~B~k."
RiijaMonk		miriana	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "Like ~I~btra~g-la~rla~k-la~gla~I ~B~rdude.~n~k"
RiijaMonk		miriana	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "~I~gAre you~I ~B~rso easily~B ~rdeceived~k?"
Minstrel		miriana	~kParrin says, "Can't you see I'm working here?"
Minstrel		miriana	~kParrin says, "It is not my place to judge, only to record deeds through verse. Although I have to admit I am delighted at the length with which this particular escapade is becoming."
Minstrel		miriana	~kParrin sings, "~I~rShe took to the roads noone wished to pass, she took to the nodes noone wished to crash. ~bThrough the light, through the dark. Miriana will blight, Miriana will bark.~n~k"
QorPriestess		Node attack	~kZuxana says, "~I~rThat power rightfully belongs to Qor and his followers, what impudence of her to try and steal that from us. Payment shall be deadly.~n~k"
QorPriestess		Node attack	~kZuxana smiles ruthlessly, "~I~rThink of the malevolent havoc we could wreck with that power. You shall get it for me, my dear. Of course it will require the death of Miriana, but so be it.~n~k"
QorPriestess		Node attack	~kZuxana says, "~I~rHa, if Tenuv'vyal was worried before I imagine she has about thrown herself off a cliff by now.~n~k"
KraananPriestess		Node attack	~kQuerti'nya says, "~B~bKraanan's justice must rain down upon her head before she accumulates enough power to serve her dark desires.~n~k"
KraananPriestess		Node attack	~kQuerti'nya says, "~B~bTo stop Miriana and her creatures of darkness you must call upon the strength of Kraanan.~n~k"
KraananPriestess		Node attack	~kQuerti'nya says, "~B~bKraanan does not deal lightly with those who use lies and chaos to seduce others, as Miriana shall soon discover.~n~k"
FarenPriestess		Node attack	~kTenuv'vyal says, "~B~gShe calls upon the worst perversions of nature to assist her in these fruitless attacks. She must be DESTROYED!~n~k"
FarenPriestess		Node attack	~kTenuv'vyal says, "~B~gI told them all that Miriana was up to no good, but did they listen to me. No they didn't and now she seeks the power of the nodes. The fools could have prevented this long ago had they only listened.~n~k"
FarenPriestess		Node attack	~kTenuv'vyal screams, "~B~gHow dare she call upon Faren's power to invoke her little games. Faren's will shall overpower her and she shall be destroyed.~n~k"
ShalillePriestess		Node attack	~kXiana says, "~bShe must be stopped, the nodes may appear fine, but one wonders when it will be enough for Miriana. We cannot take the risk of letting her continue.~k"
ShalillePriestess		Node attack	~kXiana says, "~bThe nodes have obviously defended themselves against her attacks, or they would not still be in existence.~k"
ShalillePriestess		Node attack	~kXiana says, "~bThe worst consequences occur from those actions that appear random.~k"
RiijaMonk		Node attack	~kThe Monk of Riija shimmers, "~gWhat ~B~ris~B ~bpower ~r~Ireally?~n~k"
RiijaMonk		Node attack	~kThe Monk of Riija shouts, "~B~bCome in,~B ~I~kit's open...~I ~rOh dear,~I ~gMaybe ~Bit~B ~bisn't.~n~k"
RiijaMonk		Node attack	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "~I~bIf you~I ~B~kwish to~B ~rdefeat Miriana ~gand her ~B~rcreatures, then~B ~Iyou must~I ~gstudy much!~n~k"
Minstrel		Node attack	~kParrin says, "Can't you see that the sign on the door says DO NOT DISTURB? Oh my, there is no door is there, how strange. I could have sworn there was a door there earlier."
Minstrel		Node attack	~kParrin says, "Were you involved in one of the attacks? Tell me about it, sensations, sounds, tastes, smells... Anything at all you can remember. This shall make a most excellent ballad."
Minstrel		Node attack	~kParrin says, "Describe these, creatures, that Miriana called forth. Exactly what did they look like? How tall were they? Did the glow with an otherworldly power? Oh, I must write that down, oh yes that is good."
BarloqueTailor		Node attack	~kMadelia says, "If anyone had thought to listen to the poor child, Miriana might not have had to resort to such violent actions."
BarloqueTailor		Node attack	~kMadelia says, "The nodes are refilling themselves, it is not as if Miriana is causing any permanent damage to them."
BarloqueTailor		node attack	~kMadelia says, "I am fairly certain that my opinion on the matter would be moot."
BarloqueTailor		councilors	~kMadelia says, "I have advised the Princess in private to be wary of these men, but unfortunately she believes in the inherent good of others. I can only hope that she shall see through their deceptive natures before they hurt her as well."
BarloqueTailor		councilors	~kMadelia says, "I truly thought that they wanted to help me, how was I to know that they were only lying to further their own pursuits? I have other business to attend to please leave now."
BarloqueTailor		councilors	~kMadelia says, "They are just as deceptive and evil as they claim the ones who oppose them to be, if you only knew the truth of that de...the situation. You wouldn't support them as you do now."
BarloqueTailor		venya'cyr	~kMadelia says, "As sharp as shears some would say, and just as deadly."
BarloqueTailor		hester gilk	~kMadelia says, "Her weavings always seem to be the very essence of life, although my line of clothes is much more fashionable. Her tapestries can captivate you for hours on end."
BarloqueTailor		god	~kMadelia whispers, "I have an ancient text, I found it in the lair of a necromancer, I'm not even sure they ever read it, but it tells of another God. One that with no ties to those we now worship. This God was said to have been trapped within another place so that it's presence was removed from the land. It also says that this God would return. Ever since that day I have been curious about those older legends that seemed to have ~Idissapeared~I from our records. Why would those records have been purposely lost?"
BarloqueTailor		fates	~kMadelia says, "I remember reading somewhere about a vision of three, that was in actuality different sides to the same power."
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia looks up quickly as you walk in the door, you can see the hint of tears in her eyes.
BarloqueTailor		miriana	~kMadelia says, "Many believe she is a menace, I feel that she is not only a misguided young girl, but that this is only the surface of deeper issues that shall soon be revealed to us all."
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "Do not believe all that you hear, although most is only truth tempered by perception sometimes the most trustworthy source is the least reliable information."
BarloqueTailor			~kMadelia says, "I grow tired of this facade sometimes, the only reason I still cling to it is to spare poor Kateriina any more grief then she hath already suffered."
