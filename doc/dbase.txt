Compiler class database

This is a text file read by line, whitespace mandatory between stuff.
Remember, case insensitive.

First non-whitespace on line specifies the type of line:
T = total line, must appear first in file
C = new class
M = new message
P = new parameter
Y = new property
V = new classvar
c = referenced but undefined class
m = referenced but undefined message
p = referenced but undefined parameter

T <highest non-resource # used> <highest resource # used>
C classname <unique class id> <superclass id> superclassname
M messagename <message id>
P parametername <global parameter id>
V classvarname <classvar id>
Y propertyname <property id>
c classname <unique class id>
m messagename <message id>
p parametername <global parameter id>

Superclass id of 0 means no superclass; in this case the superclassname doesn't appear.

The superclass name is ignored in all cases.
The order of parameters for each message indicates their local numbering.
Classvar IDs should be numbered starting at 0 for unparented classes,
or at the next integer after the parent's numbers for parented classes.
Property IDs should be numbered starting at 1 for unparented classes,
or at the next integer after the parent's numbers for parented classes.

This file is named kodbase.txt by default by the compiler.
