<h1> Customizable parts of Meridian</h1>
This document explains the various parts of Meridian that have
customizable parameters. These parameters can be changed while the game
is running and will alter the game experience.
<h2> How Node Attacks Work</h2>
<h3> Technical Aspects</h3>
The node attacks are controlled by an object, similar to the object
that controls the assassin&#8217;s game. In order to access this object from
the admin window, you need to enter the command: <i>send object 0
GetNodeAttack</i>. This command will return an object number which you
must then <i>show object</i> to view.
<p>The node attack object has several settable parameters. This allows
us
to customize the attacks on the fly to determine how node attacks
behave. </p>
<h3> The variables:</h3>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Default</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pbAttackEnabled</td>
      <td>0 (FALSE)</td>
      <td>Are attacks scheduled?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piAttackFrequency</td>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>The number of Meridian days minimum between scheduled
attacks. The actual
attack happens up to 2 Meridian days after it is "scheduled".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piAttackIntensity</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>The maximum number of Xeochicatl that spawn with an attack.
This number can be less, but never more.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piAttackDuration</td>
      <td>60</td>
      <td>Number of minutes the attack lasts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>12</td>
      <td>Number of Meridian days a node loss lasts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piSeveredChance</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Base percent chance a person is severed from a node instead
of merely losing it&#8217;s mana during that time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piNumberOnForAttack</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>Minimum number of people needed to be on for an attack.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pbXeoRespawn</td>
      <td>0 (FALSE)</td>
      <td>When heartstones are dropped, do Xeochicatl respawn from them
after a short period of time.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<i>Note that a Meridian day is equal to two "real" hours.</i>
<p>Xeochicatl are also not affected by DestroyDisposable if in the same
room
as a node attack. That means they won&#8217;t be cleared out of a room if
left
alone for a long time like other monsters. After a node attack, all
Xeochicatl
may be removed normally. </p>
<h3> So, what happens?</h3>
After the correct number of Meridian days pass (piAttackFrequency), a
timer is created to start the attack. The conditions are then checked
for the attack.
In order to proceed, there must not be another node attack in progress,
the
node selected must not currently be deactivated (from a previous node
attack),
and there must be a minimum number of people online
(piNumberOnForAttack). If any of these conditions are not met, then the
attack is scheduled for &frac12;
to one full Meridian day later.
<p>When an attack starts, Xeochicatl are created around the node, and
Miriana is brought from her previous location to a location near the
node. Players then have a certain number of minutes (piAttackDuration)
to kill all the Xeochicatl.
At the start of the attack, all monsters in the attacked room will die,
and
a message will be given to all players in the room. Monsters will stop
generating
in the room. All players online that have bonded with the node will get
a
message that they feel one of their nodes threatened. After 1/3 of the
total
time has passed, all online players are given a notification of which
node
is being attacked. </p>
<p>During a node attack, the Xeochicatl will be in the room and will
not leave,
even if no users show up. This means that users cannot avoid an attack
by
not going there. Note that after the attack, the Xeochicatl will
disappear
like any other monster if left alone for a period of time. </p>
<p>If all are destroyed, the node attack is averted. Note, that the
heartstones that the Xeochicatl drop can respawn into Xeochicatl if
left on the ground long enough (A variable in the Node Attack object
(pbXeoRespawn) controls if heartstones respawn into Xeochicatl). If
this feature is enabled, then the last Xeochicatl killed in a node
attack should cause heartstones to respawn
automatically. </p>
<p>If the attack is not averted, then the node is "taken". This means
the art is changed, and it will remain "dead" for a certain period of
Meridian days (piLossDuration). During this period, players who have
bonded with the
node will not get the extra mana that bonding normally gives. In
addition, no player will be able to bond with the node during this
time. There is a
chance that a player will actually be severed from the node instead
(piSeveredChance). This chance is checked individually for each
character, and is modified by
the number of nodes they already have. If severed, the player will have
to
re-bond with the node in at a future time. </p>
<p>Players online will get a message if the node is lost or severed.
Offline players will get a gmail notification of the results. </p>
<h3> Which nodes?</h3>
Currently, the node attacks are scheduled to happen at the following
nodes: <br>
NODE_H9, NODE_VICTORIA, NODE_BADLANDS, NODE_ORCCAVES, NODE_A5,
NODE_ICECAVE1
<p>Additionally, there are mechanics for another node that can have
attacks scheduled manually for NODE_Q. This node is the "Martyr's
Battleground" node.
Due to the difficulty of getting to this node, it must be scheduled
manually. </p>
<h3> Other Information</h3>
For events, an admin may open an admin window and send a node the
message <i>DoNodeAttack</i>. This will start an attack, following most
of the normal conditions. The only condition it will ignore is the
minimum number of players
online.<br>
<br>
When node attacks are activated the designer fairies in the rentable
rooms
will require heartstones from the Xeochicatl in order to place most of
the
objects within the room. &nbsp;Before activation, the designer faries
will
place any object besides a wooden box. &nbsp;Afterwards, one heartstone
will
allow you to place a number of objects based upon which heart stone is
offered.
&nbsp;It takes all four types of heartstones (sky, red, blue, brown) in
order
to place one wooden box within the room.<br>
<h2> How the Territory Game Works</h2>
The territory game now has a few customizable parameters.
<p>You can get the territory game object by sending the command: <i>send
object
0 GetTerritoryGame</i> By showing the object, you can see following
parameters: <br>
&nbsp;
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Variable</th>
      <th>Default</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piClaimWait</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>Number of minutes to wait before a flag claim is completed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piClaimRetry</td>
      <td>480</td>
      <td>Number of minutes to wait before you can claim a flag again.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piMinUsers</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>Minimum number of users needed online before you can take a
flag.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piMinAllies</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>Minimum number of allies you must have in same room to make
claim.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<h2> How the Economy Controls Work</h2>
There are new variables in the system object (object 0) that control
how much stuff drops from monsters.&nbsp; These variables work as
percentages, so that a value of 50 cuts things down by half and a value
of 200 doubles whatever the variable controls. <br>
&nbsp;
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <center><b>Variable</b></center>
      </td>
      <td>
      <center><b>Default</b></center>
      </td>
      <td>
      <center><b>Description</b></center>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piMoneyFactor</td>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>Controls the amount of money dropped by monsters when money
does drop.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piItemFactor</td>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>Controls the total number of items dropped by a monster at
death.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piMagicItemModifier</td>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>Modifies the chance that a magical item is created in a
monster's treasure.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>These controls can be used to modify the amount of loot dropped from
monsters
to put an economy back in balance. </p>
<p>One should exercise caution with the variables, however.&nbsp; A
value of piItemFactor below 25 will most likely cause monsters to stop
dropping items as monsters have a hard-coded limit of 4 items dropped
per death no
matter what.&nbsp; Also, the chance for a magical item to drop is
incredibly tiny (0.5% - 2.5% per kill in most cases).&nbsp; Increasing
piMagicItemModifier may not have much obvious effect immediately, and
decreasing it too much may
completely eliminate the chance for some monsters to drop items.&nbsp;
In
general, it should never drop below 10.<br>
</p>
<h2>How Global Player Bonuses Work<br>
</h2>
You can set bonuses for players.&nbsp; These can be useful for testing
or for special events.<br>
<h3>Advancement Bonuses</h3>
You can set a global bonus for advancment in the System object.<br>
<br>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <center><b>Variable</b></center>
      </td>
      <td>
      <center><b>Default</b></center>
      </td>
      <td>
      <center><b>Description</b></center>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">piAdvancementRate</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">100<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Sets the rate of advancement as
a percent adjustement to the secondary chance to advance.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
This variable only affects the secondary chance to advance, and affects
it as a percent.&nbsp; So, setting it to 50 makes it twice as hard to
advance (50% of base), and setting it to 200 makes it twice as easy to
advance (200% of base).&nbsp; This variable affects all spells and
skills.<br>
<h3>Spellpower Bonuses<br>
</h3>
An admin can give spellpower bonuses to the entire server through the
System object.<br>
<br>
There are two variables in System which can affect spellpower to
extreme ends.<br>
<br>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <center><b>Variable</b></center>
      </td>
      <td>
      <center><b>Default</b></center>
      </td>
      <td>
      <center><b>Description</b></center>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piFullSpellpower</td>
      <td>FALSE</td>
      <td>If set to true, makes all spells cast with maximum (99)
spellpower.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>piNoSpellPower</td>
      <td>FALSE</td>
      <td>If set to true, makes all spells cast with no (0) spellpower.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
piFullSpellpower takes precidence.<br>
<br>
There are also two messages in System used to give specific bonuses to
specific schools:<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">send object 0 SetBonusSpellpower
school int &lt;school&gt; </span>[<span style="font-style: italic;">bonus
int &lt;amount&gt;</span>] [<span style="font-style: italic;">add int
&lt;amount&gt;</span>]<br>
This sets the bonus for the selected school.&nbsp; The parameter <span
 style="font-style: italic;">bonus</span> sets the bonus to that
amount, and <span style="font-style: italic;">add</span> adds that
amount to the existing bonus.&nbsp; Either <span
 style="font-style: italic;">bonus</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">add</span> must be defined. If neither are
defined, no change is made.&nbsp; If both are defined, then <span
 style="font-style: italic;">bonus</span> is used and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">add</span> is discarded.&nbsp; The return
value is the new value of the bonus for that school.&nbsp; Either
number can be negative.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">send object 0 GetBonusSpellpower
school int &lt;school&gt;</span><br>
This gets the current bonus for the school as a return value.<br>
<br>
Note: the school constants, usable for the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">school</span> variables above are:
SS_SHALILLE, SS_QOR, SS_FAREN, SS_KRAANAN, SS_RIIJA, SS_JALA<br>
