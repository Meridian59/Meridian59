<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Lady Aftyn is a tall and slight woman, in her 50's and frail in appearance.
She has a sense of peaceful determination that can not be mistaken or overlooked,
confident, serene, and purposeful. Lady Aftyn was born into royalty and
is well educated and conscientious, having spent her life and raised a
family in an affluent environment. She was blessed by good fortune, protected
and removed from the troubles of the world. She was a patron of the arts
and humanities, and reknown for her charitable endowments and generous
disposition. Her husband passed away five years ago leaving her in late
middle age with a generous inheritance, and Lady Aftyn could easily have
reached the end of her life with not much more to contemplate than her
grandchildren, poetry, art and ettiquette. But she reached some epiphany
within herself and decided to devote the rest of her life and considerable
fortune to the study and practices of Shal'ille and to helping those in
need. She has taken a vow of poverty, and endures the outrage of her five
adult children who are aghast at the fate of their inheritance, being now
left to their own devices. Not that they're hurting by any means, they
are all powerful and connected, but they have become vindictive and angry
with the religion for having taken what they consider to be their birthright.
Angry enough to plot, certainly, but not to move yet, for to take outright
action against the peaceful forces of Shal'ille would be social suicide.
Lady Aftyn has spent the last five years studying the practices, oblivious
to the constant din of their self-centered whining, and is now opening
a shelter for the poor, sick, and wretched masses in Marion. Her vows require
that she treat anyone who comes to her for help. . . however, she is shrewd
and by no means a fool, and knows that her work can only continue if she
keeps it funded. She will require a donation to the further goals of her
church from those that don't fit her criteria of poor and wretched.</TD>
