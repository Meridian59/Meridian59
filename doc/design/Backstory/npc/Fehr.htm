<P>Though well renown throughout the land for his superb skill as a master
weapon smith, Fehr’loi Qan himself could not be considered the sharpest
sword on the rack. The large man’s slow speech seems out of place in the
high brow city of Barloque. You get the impression that he is uncomfortable
with strangers, but his great size and clear devotion to Kraanan makes
him afraid of no one.</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Plain and simple, a dim wit. Fehr’loi Qan is one of the finest Blacksmiths
in the mainland, but is nearly as well known for his slow speech. He is
uncomfortable with strangers, but his large size and clear devotion to
Kraanan, makes him afraid of no one. He has moved his shop from Tos to
Barloque. The reasons are many: uncomfort with being so close to the graveyard
of Tos, higher prices being offered in Barloque, a falling out with the
Duke and a bribe by the Princess. Fehr'loi Qan has an intense interest
in magical wands and has found unusual ways to utilize them to craft his
weapons and armor, such as using a fire wand to heat up metal more than
his forge can. Long ago, Fehr'loi Qan took a pilgrimage to the Temple of
Kraanan to learn how the great weapons of Kraanan were made centuries ago.
During his visit, the priestess taught him a simple spell of Magic Shield,
which he will now teach to anyone who asks.</TD>

<P><B>MOOD FACTOR</B></P>

<P>Strangers and talk of Tos make Fehr'loi Qan uncomfortable and decrease
his mood factor,<BR>
People who frequent his shop and magic wands tend to put him in a better
mood.</P>
