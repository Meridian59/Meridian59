<TR>
<TD>Jonas was once a great man, but he has let his life be consumed utterly
by jealousy. He has fought, both as front-line grunt and wise general,
every manner of evil that has besieged the Meridian cities, and yet he
was passed over for Rook in having the Princess' ear (in that small inferno
of courtly intrigue, he burned too many bridged to attempt to win the job
now that Rook has left), and then was overlooked in favor of Cylill when
it came time to choose a warrior to sit on the Meridian council. He fancies
himself far superior to both, particularly when it comes to strategy and
tactics, considering both men to be mere brawlers. In truth, his swordplay
is merely adequate, though his tactics are superb. The final burr in Jonas'
saddle was provided by his love for the Widow Qesino, denied from him both
by Qesino and then also by Quintor. Despite his rage and his jealousy,
Jonas has no inkling of foul play in the whole saga. Jonas wanders from
inn to tavern to inn to tavern, occasionally stopping to pay homage at
the priestess of Kraanan, the Arena of Kraanan, or the Princess' court.
Jonas knows more about the resistances and susceptibilities of monsters
than anyone in the land, and he also may have a skill to teach someone
who does him a favor. Jonas is tall, strong and armored, with dark shoulder
length hair and scars which he wears with pride. </TD>
