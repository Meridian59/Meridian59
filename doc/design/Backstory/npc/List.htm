<P><B>BARLOQUE</B></P>

<P>Notes: <BR>
&middot; Barloque generally supports the Princess <BR>
&middot; dislikes Tos (from ancient wars) <BR>
&middot; has a rat problem <BR>
&middot; Docks are the bad part of town <BR>
&middot; Doesn’t trade by sea, ports there for fishing <BR>
&middot; All NPCs of Barloque with speak with an old English style (thous
and thees)</P>

<P><B>Fehr’loi Qan (Blacksmith):</B> Plain and simple, a dim wit. Fehr’loi
Qan is one of the finest Blacksmiths in the mainland, but is nearly as
well known for his slow speech. He is uncomfortable with strangers, but
his large size and clear devotion to Kraanan, makes him afraid of no one.
Recently, the nobility of Barloque have offered him a great deal of money
to move his business up to the capital city. Fehr’loi knows that he doesn’t
truly fit in with the upper class, but could use the extra money to pay
off some old debts.</P>

<P><B>Frular (guild master)</B>: Frular is perhaps the most prosperous
man in all of Meridian and he wants to keep it that way. To that end, he
tries to maintain a low profile by not showing off his wealth (more than
is expected in Barloque). He does not want to attract the attention of
competition or additional taxes. To the Guilds, he plays the part of an
impartial middle man, but secretly he tries his best to manipulate them
against each other, lest they form alliances to get him to lower his prices.</P>

<P><B>Herbutte (Gem Shop)</B>: Fancying himself a connoisseur of the finer
things, Herbutte is little more than a old school aristocratic snob. Within
him is a dark streak of contempt for nearly all save royalty. He will never
run out of bad things to say about the other towns and the low life transients
that wander between them. </P>

<P><B>Joguer (Herb shop)</B>: The words &quot;talky&quot; and &quot;inane&quot;
come to mind when people deal with this geeky herbalist. A weird combination
of old English gentleman and suburban inventor-wannabe father. This is
the man who is always dabbling in the garage, contentedly humming to himself
as his dinner and wife get cold.</P>

<P><B>Meidei (Bartender)</B>: At one time Meidei only served the rich or
those who tipped well, until recently when he &quot;found&quot; Shal’ille.
Now a hard core bible-thumper, he almost drives his own customers away
from his ale. If you use his tavern, expect to hear an earful of rhetoric
from this stout, curly red-haired man.</P>

<P><B>Pritchett (Innkeeper)</B>: Of everyone in Barloque, Pritchett is
the least stuck up. Perhaps it is because he was not from the Royal City
and just recently moved here to perhaps buy a title. His naivet&eacute;
shows clearly as he often makes up words so as to sound important. Stingy
by nature, he pinches every shilling he can. </P>

<P><B>City Clerk (City Clerk)</B>: Saidi is a bright young woman brimming
with sex appeal. With long legs, a revealing yet officious outfit and gentle
smile, she is sure to win the affections of many men. Her goals are to
learn as much as she can about the ways of common law and one day teach
in the University of Cor Noth. At present she tries to be as helpful as
she can to the current Justicar, knowing that their references could help
her gain a permanent place at the University. Although she enjoys the attention
her looks gain her, she wants to hold out for a man who will appreciate
her when she becomes a scholar. (Because of the function of Saidi, she
will be called the &quot;city clerk&quot; as a character name, just like
the watcher)</P>

<P><B>Obert Cair’bre (Vaultman):</B> Medium height and strong, Obert is
a relatively handsome gentleman that takes great pride in his vaults. He
realizes that his customers are often in a hurry to retrieve their goods,
so he tries to keep conversation to a minimum. All are to be treated like
nobility in his eyes. If they start talking to him however, he will have
no problem expounding about his eight children, ailing mother and many
of the other rumors in town. Obert is somewhat inquisitive and sometimes
can’t help asking his customers where they happen upon their goods. </P>

<P><B>Madelia (Tailor)</B>: Used to working with the well refined tastes
of nobility, Madelia meticulously oversees her craft. However, she often
wishes to spend excessive time working on a single outfit for one of the
most powerful and esteemed members of court. There are rumors that she
pushes off the less important projects to teenage girls that are somewhere
between apprentices and slave labor. Madelia’s other hobby is to play with
the hearts of men and currently has four affairs in the works. She moved
away from Tos years ago to get away from a failing relationship with the
hypochondriac Frisconar. Although she considers that relationship over,
he still clings and sends messages all the time. When she is in need of
free magical reagents, she responds to them. She has been carrying on an
affair of convenience with Frular for several months now. He will never
leave his wife, but at present Madelia and Frular are attracted to one
another. Eventually the fling will die out, but both will savor it before
it does. Her third relationship is with Pritchett. He is genuinely in love
with her and believes that she remains faithful to him. She sees him as
a caring and well meaning man and knows that he would stick with her to
the end, but she feels she is too young to settle with him (or for him).
Her last current fling has yet to be defined, but will probably be with
a wandering NPC. Madelia is in her early thirties and his attractive and
well dressed.</P>

<P><B>TOS:</B></P>

<P>Notes: <BR>
&middot; People in Tos generally worship Kraanan and support the Duke <BR>
&middot; Resentment of Barloque <BR>
&middot; Bad talk the Princess</P>

<P><B>Frisconar (Magic shop)</B>: Keenly interested in magical reagents,
he owes his lively hood to the princess and those that learn the spells
of the gods. He also blames all of the gods for the problems of the world.
Frisconar is a hypochondriac, desperately trying to garnish attention by
expounding on his ills (real and imaginary). Frisconar used to have a fairly
serious relationship with Madelia the Barloque Tailor until she ended it.
He still desperately tries to catch her attention and is sometimes used
by her when she has need of magical reagents.</P>

<P><B>Paddock (Bartender)</B>: Paddock realizes he runs the most popular
tavern in the world. He is both cocky and friendly. To keep the bar alive,
he has become known as quite a rumor monger, spreading tales about everything
and everyone though he tries to keep a positive spin on everything. The
only thing Paddock will speak poorly of is Barloque. He does not consider
the other inns to be a threat to his business. Paddock might be played
by Harvey Keitel.</P>

<P><B>Rycksher (Blackstone Bartender):</B> The younger and less competent
brother of Paddock, who has always bailed him out of trouble in the past.
He admires his brothers stature, but would rather avoid the work. To this
end, he has sucked up to the Duke and now works in the posh and often closed
Ball Room of the Blackstone Keep. Now living an easy life, he lets his
professionalism go as he becomes tipsy during parties. He has some of the
best court gossip but isn’t smart enough to use it to his favor. Even still,
he still envies the respect his brother gets.</P>

<P><B>Skivlat (Banker):</B> Skivlat is a money nerd. He knows everything
about the history of shillings. He is not greedy in terms of what money
can buy, but more for what it is. Skivlat is always nice to customers to
the point of being annoying. He seems disappointed when people withdraw
cash, not because he misses their business, but because the vault is that
much emptier. Big eyes and a goofy smile. Not the best pick of the litter.</P>

<P><B>Watcher (arena):</B> The 20 year old son of Priestess Qerti’nya and
the former watcher, he thoroughly enjoys his post. Wars have become somewhat
unreal to him as he watches game after game, though he does hope to help
every person reach their potential in case the Orcs invade his beloved
town. He was appointed to this position by the Duke as a favor to his mother.
Note that his father died at the update and he is relatively new to his
position.</P>

<P><B>MARION- The Heartland of Meridian</B></P>

<P>Notes: <BR>
• Marion is a bastion of support for Shal'ille<BR>
• Farming community <BR>
• Country people <BR>
• Heavy clothing, simple patterns (plaids and broadcloth)</P>

<P><B>Tova (Bartender at The Limping Toad)</B>- A boisterous and bellowing
man who takes life as it comes through the door of The Limping Toad, serving
drinks and telling a never ending stream of jokes to the local farmhands
and occasional traveler. Tova is open and congenial; the warmth of his
public house matches his ruddy smile and huge strong belly, the result
of thirty-five years of working and drinking at his thriving, if somewhat
slower paced, pub. He pokes fun at Meridian's different cities and their
inhabitants in an attempt to get a laugh out of his customers, but he especially
makes fun of Marionites. His best audience however, is Morrigan who idolizes
the man and laughs at everything he says, or even what he imagines Tova
might say. Tova is tall, broad, and smiling in shirt sleeves and a leather
apron. His pub is renown for it's powerful stout.</P>

<P><B>Morrigan (Shopkeeper at The Limping Toad)</B>- The second part of
the comedy duo with Tova, Morrigan is a giggling simpleton. Lovable, grinning
fool. He runs a shop buying and selling sundries and reagents in the same
building as the tavern, but you get the feeling that his heart really isn't
in it, he keeps his little shop open just to be near his hero, Tova. He
just can't wait to see what's going to come out of the mans mouth next.
Morrigan is short and slight, wearing similar country grab to Tova but
without an apron, pants made perhaps in a tartan wool.</P>

<P><B>Colhorr (Blacksmith)-</B> Colhorr is a man of very few words, mostly
because he's deaf from too many years of the constant clanging of sledge
hammer on iron. He doesn't pick up much around him, and consequently doesn't
have much to offer. He is in his late fifties and putters about with the
slow familiarity of a man very comfortable in his own environment. He is
large and bulky but quite short, gray bearded, shirtless in heavy trousers.
He generates most of his business by fabricating and repairing plows, hoes,
shovels and other farming implements, and in truth makes pretty sub-standard
weapons and armor.</P>

<P><B>Ran er'Hoth (Wise Man)</B>- Wise man or village idiot? It really
depends upon who you talk to. Ran er'Hoth is an old (bordering on ancient)
member of the Marion community who has taken on a somewhat legendary status
in the other areas of Meridian, and is sought out for his opinions and
knowledge by pilgrims and travelers. The good people of Marion do their
best to ignore him, because in their minds he has cried wolf just one too
many times. Generations ago and for many years he was a fairly successful
seer to the local population. By taking his signs from the more ancient
practices of studying the intestines of herd animals, the thickness of
an onions' skin, the color of the rings around the moon and the like, Ran
er'Hoth could predict with some accuracy weather, seasons, crop yields,
and other events of practical significance to this agrarian community.
He established himself and enjoyed the support of the citizens, but was
renown only locally. Then about twenty years ago he lost it, though unbeknownst
to the township, who fled to the mountains after he predicted a flood of
water that would swallow the houses and cover the earth. They returned
to Marion weeks later to find their herds and fields in shambles, from
neglect not water, and their reputation as Meridians most thick headed
and gullible people solidly reinforced. Then he predicted a termite epidemic
that never panned out, but he got all the Marionites to spread dung over
any exposed wood on their houses and tools to protect them. More laughter
and jeers from the big city and mountain folk. This was followed by a supposed
turnip famine, the foretelling of a fire-breathing pig that would kill
anything in its' path, a non-existent sandstorm, and the vision of a rebellion
by the people of Jasper, all of which the good people of Marion reacted
to accordingly. Meanwhile an unforeseen early frost followed directly by
unseasonable spring rains ruined the harvest, and that was it for the old
man. He left the village to walk the land a pauper, none of the locals
would believe him any longer. His prophetic ramblings went on through his
self-imposed exile, and strangely, he began to make sense (in the most
abstract terms) to some element of the people he encountered and drew a
following. He returned to the village five years ago and all had been forgiven,
the locals bring food and water to his hut, and people come from all over
the land to visit him for guidance. In a small town like Marion this qualifies
as a full blown tourist attraction, and he's actually good for the local
economy. He is withered and hunched with wisps of white hair and the furious
eyes of a lunatic. He might be dresses like a homeless man, layers of worn
clothing.</P>

<P><B>Lady Aftyn- (Healer)</B> Lady Aftyn is a tall and slight woman, in
her 50's and frail in appearance. She has a sense of peaceful determination
that can not be mistaken or overlooked, confident, serene, and purposeful.
Lady Aftyn was born into royalty and is well educated and conscientious,
having spent her life and raised a family in an affluent environment. She
was blessed by good fortune, protected and removed from the troubles of
the world. She was a patron of the arts and humanities, and reknown for
her charitable endowments and generous disposition. Her husband passed
away five years ago leaving her in late middle age with a generous inheritance,
and Lady Aftyn could easily have reached the end of her life with not much
more to contemplate than her grandchildren, poetry, art and ettiquette.
But she reached some epiphany within herself and decided to devote the
rest of her life and considerable fortune to the study and practices of
Shal'ille and to helping those in need. She has taken a vow of poverty,
and endures the outrage of her five adult children who are aghast at the
fate of their inheritance, being now left to their own devices. Not that
they're hurting by any means, they are all powerful and connected, but
they have become vindictive and angry with the religion for having taken
what they consider to be their birthright. Angry enough to plot, certainly,
but not to move yet, for to take outright action against the peaceful forces
of Shal'ille would be social suicide. Lady Aftyn has spent the last five
years studying the practices, oblivious to the constant din of their self-centered
whining, and is now opening a shelter for the poor, sick, and wretched
masses in Marion. Her vows require that she treat anyone who comes to her
for help. . . however, she is shrewd and by no means a fool, and knows
that her work can only continue if she keeps it funded. She will require
a donation to the further goals of her church from those that don't fit
her criteria of poor and wretched.</P>

<P><B>JASPER- Let Sleeping Dogs Lie</B></P>

<P>Notes: <BR>
• Dark feeling, a dreary town <BR>
• People wear cold weather clothes, dark wool vests/shawls <BR>
• Religion is ambivalent</P>

<P><B>Pietro (Tavern keeper, Pietro's Wicked Brews)</B>- Twelve years ago
this tavern was a profitable and bustling business, serving drinks and
food to the never ending shifts of hard-pan miners coming from and going
back to work in the shafts sunk deep into these jagged hills, and the money
flowed freely. In those days you might have described Pietro as a sullen
man, irritable even, who conducted business on terse terms and liked to
take a nip behind the bar. But ten years ago the ore dried up, and the
miners moved on and took the prosperity with them. They left behind a ghost
town inhabited by the same superstitious, wary mountain folk who had existed
here before the mines and will be here forever. And the last decade hasn't
served to improve Pietro's attitude much, or his drinking. Now you could
describe him as peevish and inflammatory, a suspicious man, and a mean
drunk. He carves a bleak existence out serving the few travelers looking
for a safe port in these mountains, but that's fine with him, because he
doesn't have patience for people and their incessant chatter. He sulks
behind the bar pretending to look occupied when strangers come in, generally
answering questions with a movement from his head, a shrug of his shoulders,
or a grunt. If a stranger isn't ordering, they aren't welcome. He is of
medium height, in his early forties, and razor thin with black hair pulled
back tight into a pony tail. His face is sallow, pock marked, and shows
the effects of heavy drinking. He dresses for the mountains, perhaps a
woolen vest, heavy shirt, no hat. He does not make eye contact.</P>

<P><B>The Widow Qesino (Innkeepers Wife, Yonder Inn)</B> Until very recently
Qesino ran the inn in Jasper, with Mrs. Qesino in the background. That
is to say, Qesino sat behind the counter and greeted the infrequent guest,
counted the money and fretted about all the business he felt he was missing
out on, while Mrs. Qesino was up before dawn to start the fire, do the
baking, the sweeping, scrub the floors, get Qesinos' breakfast, do the
shopping, split and stack the firewood, make the beds, and on, and on.
After fifteen years of this, guess what happened next? Qesino left the
inn one morning, some months back, on one of his periodic business trips
to Tos (he never trusted Yevitan, at the Jasper bank) and he disappeared.
Never showed up in Tos, never came back to Jasper. Supposedly had a bunch
of gold with him too, hidden, but that never showed up either. At first
there were a few rumors, Jasper being a small town and all that implies;
maybe an avalanche, someone said, or a troll was another theory. But then
two weeks after Qesinos' disappearance (the search parties were just returning)
Quintor the blacksmith moved into the inn and people in Jasper just quit
talking about it altogether. Funny thing about the mountains, rocks are
always falling on things, covering them up. There's a lot of stuff that
goes missing, and you'll just never see again. So the Widow Qesino takes
care of the inn, like before, but now she counts the money too. She is
in her late thirties, heavy set, straightforward. She will gladly rent
you a room or feed you, but the pleasantries are kept to a minimum. She
might wear a shawl; she's industrious and busy, makes time for a curt hello
to everyone in town. It's hard to tell if anyone noticed, but she didn't
cry at the wake.</P>

<P><B>Quintor- (Blacksmith)</B> A quiet, brooding man who keeps to himself.
Years ago, before the mines shut down he was quite successful fabricating
mining tools and was happily married to a beautiful young woman from Jasper.
Quintor was in the process of building a nice life for himself when the
mines bottomed out and his world came crashing down around him. His business
dried up overnight, and his young bride left for greener pastures with
on of the departing mine executives. Quintor was devastated, and for a
town and a people that shows little of itself to the outside world, he
uncharacteristically cried and grieved and screamed her name for months.
In the midst of his despair he turned his angst into his work, dedicating
himself to superhuman efforts with fire and iron. He could be heard screaming
and groaning through many days and nights at his forge. It is said that
after Quintor made his first blade, which you can still see up in his shop,
he mysteriously left town for three months and then just as mysteriously
reappeared one morning, and a peace seemed to have settled over him. He
hung the blade up on the wall, and never mentioned his wife again. Quintor
truly came into his own when he switched to forging weapons to keep his
shop and spirits alive. Even now he works very hard at his trade and is
widely recognized as the finest weapon maker in Meridian. He produces weapons
in limited numbers and is very proud of his work. If a player walks into
his shop with a weapon that he made, he will recognize the weapon immediately.
He has the jet black, full hair is that is characteristic of people from
Jasper, but is bearded and tall, and very thin. He wears a wool cap and
a thick leather vest over his shirt. He lives at the inn, and stays away
from the local squabbles and gossip. Although no one ever asked him for
an alibi for the morning Qesino disappeared, a couple people seem to remember
that he was away hunting in the mountains at the time. But that's not the
kind of thing that anyone should be talking about, the good people of Jasper
know that it is always better to let sleeping dogs lie. </P>

<P><B>Yevitan- (Royal Bank of Jasper)</B> Yevitan is very old, and a very
shrewd businessman. Although in his old age he runs the Royal Bank in Jasper
(which is owned by the Duke) as a younger man he was summoned to the capitol
and eventually became the Financial Minister for King Zarcos V. Despite
being an outsider from the circles of nobility (no person from Jasper would
ever be considered more than a stranger to be wary of to the 'nobility')
his intelligence allowed him to become very close to the King, and crucial
to his reign. Yevitan became very powerful, both politically and financially.
But when the King died Yevitans' umbrella of protection died with him,
and his political enemies (which were many) banished him from power and
stripped him of his lands. If the Duke had not intervened, he would have
been executed as well. But the Duke felt that he might be useful as long
as he could keep him relatively out of sight of his enemies, and the perfect
opportunity presented itself. The Duke sent Yevitan back to his home town
of Jasper on a business venture, to start a bank and take advantage of
the then booming mines. A good move on the Dukes' part, because he knew
full well that the people of Jasper would never accept an outsider that
tried to do business there, and a good move for Yevitan because he kept
his head. But that doesn't necessarily mean that Yevitan is ingratiated
to the Duke, in fact he has no loyalty to him at all. In his view his salvation
was strictly a business transaction, a debt which Yevitan has now paid
in full. In the past decade since the closing of the mines, the bank has
ceased to be an important asset to the Duke, and Yevitan is all but forgotten
in Royal circles. But while keeping a low profile, Yevitan has plenty of
time to do some thinking of his own, and has managed to amass another fortune.
Now he's waiting for the perfect time, and he'll make his move to raise
an army and take power. His political views are much more conservative
than the Dukes', he believe that there must be a monarch at ANY price,
although he knows that King isn't the position he would hold in the new
court. He is always quietly looking for a candidate, and awaiting the time
to strike. He is spry for being an elderly man, short and slightly plump.</P>

<P><B>Zhieu B'hob (General Storekeeper)</B>- Zhieu B'hob is probably the
only citizen of Jasper who actually is excited to see players in town.
The reason is simple, he wants to see his business thrive. Even so, his
excitement is only relative to the rest of the Jasper folk, he just shares
a little less of the guarded skepticism that seems a hallmark of the citizens
here. He is cordial and friendly though, politely administering to the
needs of his customers. Zhieu B'hob is of medium height and build and is
young in appearance. He could wear a sweater and dark woolen vest. He has
made himself responsible for feeding and clothing Afiera D'xor, and some
say that he is the wise man's secret pupil.</P>

<P><B>Afiera D'xor (Wise Man)</B> He has spent many years in retreat in
the surrounding mountains, and now devotes all of his time to stone carving.
Afiera D'xor is a master artisan who carves intricate designs suggesting
infinity and mathematical perfection, images that wrap around themselves
in endless repetition. He is also sought out by travelers who hope to share
some of the wisdom he has gained from a life of meditation and solitude.
He is very old and slightly hunched, and his wiry frame give away the hidden
strength he possesses only when he is at work with his hammer and chisel.
Dressed in the comfortable, warm, and utilitarian garb of the mountain
people. He looks very weathered, and it is said of him that he has an understanding
of the spirit of Jala that goes far beyond what anyone perceives.</P>

<P><B>COR NOTH- The Crossroads </B></P>

<P>• University Town <BR>
• Multicultural center of trade and ideas</P>

<P><B>Solomon (Solomon's Edibles)</B>- Solomon has fine and exotic taste
in goods, as his shop in this multicultural trading city reflects. He has
collected goods and art from travelers from every corner of the known worlds,
and is rumored to have artifacts and relics from even beyond that. He is
interested in hearing tales, and is very well traveled himself, although
it would be impossible to say just where he might be from. If you were
to hang around his shop for a couple days, you would hear more languages
spoken there than you could identify, yet Solomon seems comfortable conversing,
haggling, and joking around in all of them. Solomon is in his early forties,
and dresses richly in exotic clothes. He offers a cup of tea to customers
that look as though they might have a story to tell. He has a very relaxing
presence, as he is confident and comfortable. He also has a couple of apartments
above his shop that he will rent out as they become available.</P>

<P><B>D'Franco (Cibilo Creek Inn)</B>- D'Franco is a good old fashioned
business conservative, and a strong supporter of the Duke. He believes
in a stronger military, and served when he was younger, fighting without
distinction in a campaign against the Orcish Hoards the action at Tangee
Bluff. He is very outspoken in his political views, but tolerant toward
intelligent discussion from all viewpoints. His inn is a common gathering
place for students and scholars from the nearby university, and often the
site of great debate about every manner of issue. D'Franco is late middle
aged, good looking with close cropped gray hair and is very outspoken.
His dress is comfortable and muted.</P>

<P><B>Rook (Weapon Master)</B>- Rook is a nobleman with a fanatical loyalty
to the Princess. So much so, in fact, that it drove him out of the Court,
for his temper would always get the best of him if he felt a slight to
his honor or that of the Princess, and he would duel. As the practice of
dueling is strictly forbidden in the Royal Court, he eventually became
awkward to the Princess faction and was sent away. He has set up in Cor
Noth and dedicated his vast knowledge of weapon skills and tactics to commercial
ends. His obsession with the Princess, despite his exile from favor, has
not diminished a bit. As a young man, his father was a general under the
King, and Rook received the finest military education possible. He served
as a career officer in the King's Army, and proved to be a critical figure
to the Kingdom during numerous wars, courageous, brave, and brilliant on
the battlefield. The problem was/is, during peacetime he is something of
an embarrassment, as he is quite extreme. Dressed in the finery of a nobleman,
Rook has a trim shorter than average figure, and a grand mustache. Rook
holds his fellow citizens of Cor Noth in contempt for what he feels are
their liberal, tolerant views. Ironically, it is because of these same
tolerant views that Cor Noth is the only settlement in Meridian that would
accept Rook. But he is hard-nosed and vain. It is commonly known that Rook
sees his fighting academy as only a past time, and at times he seems very
indifferent to the whole thing. He is waiting for the time that his Princess
needs him again, and he anxiously awaits the messenger that calls him to
her cause.</P>

<P><B>Hester Gilk- (Tailor)</B> Hester is old and quite small, from a very
distant land. She is incredibly adept with her fingers, and the quality
of the clothing she produces is very good. She is secretive about her past,
and is quiet and attentive toward her customers. She lives above her shop
in a small apartment, and ocassionally there are strange comings and goings
of quiet people at all hours, but nothing that has alerted the reasonable
suspicions of anyone but the busybodies around Cor Noth. But busybodies
will be busybodies, and the rumors about who comes and goes and why vary
as widely as a coven of illegal magicians who gather to focus their dark
powers, to an enchanted room where every fantasy can exist. In actuality,
and in what will eventually be eluded to, she is a political and religious
refugee from somewhere in her secret past, and will ocassionally use her
basement as a stop in a mysterious underground of people moving about Meridian
that remain unseen, and unknowable.</P>

<P><B>COUNCIL MEMBERS:</B></P>

<P>Notes: <BR>
&middot; They control Meridian politics. All are well respected and hand
groomed by the former King. <BR>
&middot; It should be considered to make one or two of them women, or emphasize
that they run half the world, while the priestesses run the other half.
Because Riija Monk will probably be a man, I suggest making a council woman.</P>

<P><B>Alzahakar: </B>One of the oldest friends of King Zarcos V, Alzahakar
has been counseling the princess since birth. An amalgamation of the middle
eastern sorcerer Jafar and Obi-Wan Kenobi, he has mastered all magic except
Jala and Riija. Having the will of four gods in him, he is very careful
about how he wields his knowledge. Excruciating balance is the only way
he can avoid the wrath of any one deity. If Alzahakar has a flaw, it is
his ego finding himself above all lesser magicians.</P>

<P><B>Bei Naq:</B> A small vulture like man stuffed in extravagant robes
of gold and jewels, he lives in constant fear of others wanting his treasures.
Through his studies, he located numerous jewel mines and remains the richest
in the land, although his purse is seldom opened. Bei Naq leans towards
the Duke, since the princess does not respect the value of capitalism.
He knows that one day he will be done in by a greedy thief and has hoarded
his treasures away.</P>

<P><B>Cylill: </B>A combat veteran of the wars with Ukgoth, he has mastered
every skill of combat. Dressed in light armor and military formal regalia,
he lounges at his hut like a general during disgusting peacetime. Cylill
has had a long past serving with the Duke’s forces in protecting the world
from Trolls and has many war stories to tell. Even in unrelated topics,
he will make allegories to his war days.</P>

<P><B>Drechx:</B> A wise physician, he is rumored to have perfected his
body’s healing capacity. Drechx seems to have two states, when he is deep
in a trance toning his body’s inner alignment and when he is on his high
on life fits. Essentially unclothed, his body is old and weathered yet
perfectly fit. Drechx has big bushy eye brows over his wide set eyes. He
truly believes the voice of the people should dictate who leads them and
allows his alliance to sway between the Duke and Princess.</P>

<P><B>Esseldi:</B> A great traveler and explorer, he now hunts for the
appearances of the mystical mana nodes. Esseldi attempts to wear the stately
dress of the court, yet always manages to tatter them up on his impromptu
explorations. He enjoys talking about all of his findings, whether relevant
to anyone else or not. It is common for his to say &quot;that reminds me
of…&quot; something that has very little to do with what he was discussing.</P>

<P><B>PRIESTESSES:</B></P>

<P>Notes: <BR>
&middot; All strictly follow their own god and frown on worshipping any
other.</P>

<P><B>Qerti’nya (Kraanan): </B>Qerti’nya is very judgmental of the strength
of those who come before her. Blood and hellfire are the tools of this
priestess, for only the strong and good meaning deserve to live. She is
quick to make accusations or statements. Those of Kraanan should always
speak their minds, for deception is the way of the enemy. Although she
delivers a powerful sermon, she is likely to go out drinking with the men
after it is over. She is strong and determined and wears a tabard emblazoned
with a fist.</P>

<P><B>Tenuv’vyal (Faren): </B>Hair unkempt and anger barely checked. Some
say she is on the brink of madness, others say she is a terrible menace
waiting to be released like a raging storm. She despises civilization and
feels humans must return to the ways of the wilds. Her appearance resembles
that of a wiccan priestess, with simple yet ceremonial effects. Secretly
she desires the rebirth of the Jala religion as is the will of Faren. She
can become dangerous at the mention of Qor.</P>

<P><B>Xiana (Shal’ille): </B>Clean and prim, this priestess of peaceful
serenity speaks only kind words. She even wishes peace on those of Qor
and prays for their redemption. Xiana is slightly air-headed, slightly
more concerned with brushing her hair than attending to matters of state.
She will always kowtow to the will of Kraanan and his faithful, before
asserting her own needs. She realizes that some feel she is giving woman
a deeming image, but she tells them the strength of women is in matters
of peace.</P>

<P><B>Zuxana (Qor):</B> The perfect servant of Qor the Vile. Shadows deepen
where this malevolent woman stands. She has a devious sensuality that she
will exploit to turn men (and women) to succumb to the dark will of Qor.
If she can not seduce others to Qor, she would rather see them dead. Everyone
and everything is just a object to be used and thrown away by her. </P>

<P><B>FACTIONS:</B></P>

<P>Notes: <BR>
&middot; The Duke and Princess are continually trying to gain support of
the council, both know that when the King passes away (technically he is
still in control, though he has entrusted the council with running the
day to day)</P>

<P><B>Duke Kalior:</B> Pompous and smug, he knows that the general population
of the land prefers his methods and experience over those of the Princess.
A big believer in the Golden Rule (he who has the gold…), the Duke supports
sound trade economics and profitable merchants and a healthy tax. His hatred
for the princess goes beyond, her via for &quot;his&quot; throne; She was
the product of Katria love for Zarcos over himself. He is far too courtly
to outwardly attack the princess and relies on innuendoes and crowd pleasing
ploys to sway control. The Duke appreciates those who show correct court
etiquette and may ignore those who do not refer to him by a stately title.</P>

<P><B>Princess Kateriina:</B> The princess who dreams about being a princess.
Never having a mother or sibling and losing her father to insanity, she
has been saddled with immense responsibility at a young age. She does not
understand why the Duke dislikes her, but knows that she must appear as
a strong opposition. She is admired by her subjects for her kind heart
and underdog position against tyranny of those like the Duke. Overall she
is enthralled by magic and sees it as the salvation for Meridian.</P>

<P><B>KONIMA ISLAND</B></P>

<P><B>Magical Reagent Shopkeeper</B>- A large, slow moving woman who obviously
enjoys the earthly pleasures, the Magical Reagent Shopkeeper could easily
be seen running the exact same shop with the same mannerisms on contemporary
Haight Street or in Ashland, Oregon. She dresses in loose, comfortable
gowns, smokes a little clay pipe, meditates, and has the understanding
and straight forward approach business of someone who has been stoned for
a great many years. Earthy, cool. (Possible reference Janis Joplin, Momma
Cass?) • Will buy and sell the reagents for Riija spells • Might also have
some clothing for sale, robes for magic user types • Might also sell a
few health food items</P>

<P><B>General Store Manager</B>- This small and somewhat scattered man
runs what at first glance looks like an immense scrap heap formed into
a maze. with walls to partially support it. Think of a very cluttered garage,
multiply the amount of junk by three, and undercoat the place with a layer
of dust and soot as thick as a dime. The manager has a remarkable system
of organization though, and there are some real gems buried in this shop.
His pricing structure is erratic, and his approach to business not very
salesman-like. He seems to empathize with every item in the shop, and is
maybe a bit sorry to make a sale at all. Middle aged, librarian-like. •
Will sell a variety of equipment for adventuring</P>

<P><B>Blacksmith</B>- The blacksmith of The Settlement is a powerful, early
middle aged woman. She has a big strong body and the mouth of a longshoreman,
to the point that her cursing has assumed legendary status locally. She
is a fine blacksmith, and very proud of her work and her reputation. She
looks disdainfully upon most of the work from the blacksmiths on the Meridian
mainland. Early in her career her point of pride centered around being
a woman in a trade that is predominately male; now she would ignore the
hesitation of any customers surprised to see her swinging a sledge hammer
into molten iron or masterfully sharpening a neurodite sword. • Sells weapons
and armor • Will handle the NPC mending on Konima's</P>

<P><B>Bone Priestess-</B> Although the various Avar societies on the Island
are factionalized, involved in a prolonged civil war, and can't agree on
much of anything, there is one thing that all the Avars understand. The
Bone Priestess is stark, raving mad. And she is. The Bone Priestess is
a female Avar who is in permanent exile from the various Avar societies
on Konima's Island, living in isolation on the north shore. She has been
visited upon by demons (the illusionary magic of the manipulative Riija
Monk included) and is convinced that she has shamanistic powers, even though
she was not born with the mutations to be included in this sect. It is
impossible to ascertain whether her rituals, totems, fire pits, and skull
and bone structures are indeed conjuring any arcane energy, because she
is completely insane. • Bone Priestess supplies the fourth piece of the
Quest.</P>

<P><B>Master of the Trading Post-</B> A remarkable man fallen upon a very
rough life, the Master of the Trading Post was born on the Meridian mainland
and raised in the persecuted secret society of the last Riija school magicians.
This underground community was being hunted down and annihilated, and as
the last living practitioner he fled his successful business and political
position as he could, banking his life on the gamble of a legendary island
where Riija flourished. He now lives outside of every group on the Island
running a neutral, fortified trading post near the Avar village where Avar
traders, human smugglers, rival warriors and outlaws of every description
meet. He speaks fluently the Avar, Konimas, and Meridian tongue and is
adept at the Riija magic, as well as being tough enough to earn an enforced
neutrality for his tavern/inn/post. But he's not teaching anybody anything,
or telling one one-millionth of what he knows. Large, heavyset man, late
middle aged. His appearance could be thought of as a somewhat soiled nobility;
intelligence and power corrupted by suspicion and the brutality of survival.
• Tavern, inn, and store functions • Supplies the third piece of the Quest
Banker: Portly fellow, wearing a neatly pressed official type business
outfit. Vaultman: Near twin of Banker. Wears same outfit (yet it doesn’t
fit right) and has same hair style. Overweight, yet in an opposite sense
as the Banker (tubby vs stout). The Vaultman is always bickering with the
Banker, who shares the same building. &middot; runs bank and rents vault
space. If programming allows, this could be a Siamese twin (connected at
the arm or waist)</P>

<P><B>Weapons Master: </B>An older man who is obviously blind in both eyes.
His age makes him near devoid of fat or muscle, yet his body remains sinewy;
his arms are tight and ancient ropes of tendons. His every move exacting,
his every word said with forethought, this former warrior defines the slow
grace of a seasoned hunter. Noted for his keen ear, some say he can hear
those things that make no noise, like a frown or unspoken words. &middot;
In a wing of the Hall of Heroes &middot; teaches bow skills and advanced
weapon skills</P>

<P><B>Language Master:</B> Brilliant yet begrudged by most of the island
for his age, this smarmy youth rose from an annoying book worm to one of
the most sought after individuals due to his extensive knowledge of languages.
He regards most the adults around him as intellectual inferiors who can’t
appreciate his mind. He is reminiscent of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (Romeo
&amp; Juliet, What’s Eating Gilbert Grape). &middot; In a wing of the Hall
of Heroes &middot; Teaches Konima island language, knows lots of history</P>

<P><B>Bartender:</B> This one armed middle aged man continually grouses
about how the army screwed him over by discharging him after he lost his
arm in a war with the Avars. Other NPCs will claim that he was dismissed
for his piss poor attitude and that his disability has nothing to do with
it. The years of bitterness has lead him to become a scruffy and stained
bartender with little care for his establishment or his customers.</P>

<P><B>Tailor: </B>This little bald man brims with nervous energy. His over-caffinated
attitude and tiny spectacles hide a truly shady individual. Perhaps this
is an act so his illegal practices go unnoticed by the guards, or maybe
it is the fear of discovery that causes his peculiar personality. &middot;
Part of underground…can get you Nerudite &middot; Sells native clothing</P>

<P><B>Innkeeper: </B>Dressed in immaculate formal wear similar to the banker,
this enigmatic man comes across as an amateur investor. Always trying to
rope players into his latest risky investment (or perhaps desperate to
pay off the last one that didn’t work out), he approaches all with an info-mercial
style smile. &middot; Rents houses, apartments and guildhalls &middot;
Potentially asks players to invest money in his schemes; if players offer
money to him specifically for these investments, they will never see a
return.</P>

<P><B>Bow Maker: </B>This becoming, young woman appears as cold and curt
to new faces. Despite that, it is obvious to all that her true passion
lies in crafting fine bows. Years ago, so she says, her father was exiled
from the settlement for his irrational devotion to following Riija and
the ways of the woods. Now, he is too old or tired to help those who seek
the temple of Riija, so she begrudgingly does his duties (see temple quest).
She explains that he is too sick to come out from his room (and scolds
anyone who tries the inner door), does the quest requirement, then gets
back to her woodworking. Curiously, another NPC will claim that her father
has been dead for years. &middot; Sells and mends bows &middot; Temple
Quest NPC</P>

<P><B>Mad Scientist:</B> This moody elder man is obsessed with his secret
experiments. He does not take well to visitors and tends to make them paranoid
by treating them like potential objects of experimentation. His room should
be full of bizarre items, dead animal, and mysterious apparatuses. His
hawk nose and beady eyes seem to take apart the players as he makes overly
intuitive surmises of them (what items they have, whether they are good
or evil, when they last ate, whatever can be programmed). &middot; Temple
Quest NPC &middot; Might give player random (bad) potions or other experiments.</P>

<P><B>Riija Monk:</B> Misleading, mysterious and anonymous describe this
nearly telepathic individual. This &quot;not quite human&quot; holy man
should have two forms. See Damion for the common one (floating in a monk’s
robe with one giant eye). The other form is revealed when dispel illusion
is cast. When revealed, Riija is actually a spooky little girl. &middot;
Teaches Riija spells &middot; Manipulates the Quest NPCs into doing his
work. Captains Of the Guard- This is the highest ranking officer who attends
to the day to day tasks of soldiering rather than the strategic and political
ambitions of the Generals in the Konimas Army, which in a militaristic
society is a very powerful position. There are two Captains of the Guard,
that alternate shifts at the main gate to the city regulating the flow
of people and materials between The Settlement and the enemies of The State
outside. What passes this checkpoint depends a lot on who you talk to.
The good Captain is the well-educated son of a very rich and influential
merchant family, who has risen rapidly to this prestigious position through
hard work, intelligence, and adhering to the rules. He is doubtlessly being
groomed for a position on the General Staff. He is fair, and has compassion
for the men that he leads, and indeed has earned the respect of many common
soldiers, and most of the civilian community. He is well mannered, tall,
athletic and muscled, in his early thirties. He wears the impeccable uniform
of a career military officer, and has the no-nonsense, crisp personality
to match. The bad Captain is also a career officer, but of a very different
breed. Inducted into the army at a young age, he has spent his life coming
up through the ranks the hard way, and is a well decorated veteran of many
campaigns. He is also very intelligent, but is illiterate with no formal
education. The common soldiers also respect him, but because he is a mean,
ruthless soldier that doesn't play politics and gets results. He is a tough
son of a bitch that uses his position for whatever he can, but is smart
enough about it to avoid trouble with his superiors. The citizens tolerate
him even though he occasionally will get drunk with his men and run amok,
again, he gets results. He is in his early forties, powerful, and wears
his uniform with pride.</P>

<P><B>WANDERING</B></P>

<P><B>Jonas D'Accor the Jealous General.</B> Jonas was once a great man,
but he has let his life be consumed utterly by jealousy. He has fought,
both as front-line grunt and wise general, every manner of evil that has
besieged the Meridian cities, and yet he was passed over for Rook in having
the Princess' ear (in that small inferno of courtly intrigue, he burned
too many bridged to attempt to win the job now that Rook has left), and
then was overlooked in favor of Cylill when it came time to choose a warrior
to sit on the Meridian council. He fancies himself far superior to both,
particularly when it comes to strategy and tactics, considering both men
to be mere brawlers. In truth, his swordplay is merely adequate, though
his tactics are superb. The final burr in Jonas' saddle was provided by
his love for the Widow Qesino, denied from him both by Qesino and then
also by Quintor. Despite his rage and his jealousy, Jonas has no inkling
of foul play in the whole saga. Jonas wanders from inn to tavern to inn
to tavern, occasionally stopping to pay homage at the priestess of Kraanan,
the Arena of Kraanan, or the Princess' court. Jonas knows more about the
resistances and susceptibilities of monsters than anyone in the land, and
he also may have a skill to teach someone who does him a favor. Jonas is
tall, strong and armored, with dark shoulder length hair and scars which
he wears with pride. </P>

<P><B>Miriana the Heretic.</B> No one knows what to make of Miriana. She
is barely a woman, young and innocent, and yet she is widely watched by
the religious community of Meridian. She is always barely dressed, thin,
lithe, and red-haired, and she is to be found dancing, arms outstretched
to the heavens out in the forest, anytime, day or night. Miriana is most
well-known for her heretical statements. She disputes that the Gods ever
walked the earth as human (a view which is widely scorned by all schools
of Mainland meridian). She also is well-known for her claims about the
relationship of Shal'ille and Faren, which seem to vary at random. Sometimes
she claims they were twins, other times, that they were lovers, and yet
other times that they are the same. Needless to say, mainstream Meridian
laughs at these beliefs. And yet she carries herself as if she believes
it fully, appreciating the peace and the fury of the wild. Animals leave
her unmolested always. Miriana dances in place in parts of the forest where
players rarely have reason to go. Rumor has it that the magics of both
schools run freely through Miriana. Miriana is rumored to know a new spell
or two. Miriana is loathed by Xiana because of her heretical beliefs towards
Shal'ille. Qerti'nya hates her because Miriana speaks of Kraanan with total
contempt, and Tenuv'vyal is terrified that Miriana will someday replace
her. Only Zuxana treats Miriana with respect and admiration - because she
knows that Tenuv'vyal is right.</P>

<P><B>Parrin Aragone.</B> Parrin is widely known in Meridian, but rarely
spoken of favorably. He is a widely traveled bard, and one with an extremely
gifted set of hands, but his songs, particularly his lyrics, tend to provoke
groans of disgust. They tend towards the inane, with the only glimpse of
true 'cleverness' being in occasional puns so bad that one's first reaction
is to throw something at the bard. Parrin seems to wear the groans as a
badge of pride. Parrin travels from inn to inn to tavern to tavern (avoiding
Tova, who threatened to kill him if he ever set foot in his inn again,
although no one knows why). He also has been known to visit both the Duke's
chambers and the Princess' castle. Parrin has learned a new trick of late,
and that is including names of PCs in his songs, slipping the names of
PCs who have killed the yeti, raided guild halls, visited the island or
performed other heroic acts into his act. If you give him a tip, he may
even force your name into a song, although whether or not you'll be pleased
by the result is another story. Give him a particularly large tip, and
he may play his only popular song, a whimsical tune about an island, far
far away. Parrin is a short, thin, sandy hair man in his mid twenties who
wears smarmy silk clothes.</P>

<P><B>Maleval.</B> This tall, imposing and dark figure is notable in one
way. He is the only person in the Meridian land to insist that the Gods
are merely a convenient way to describe that which cannot be explained,
which is to say magic. He claims that magic comes from cleverly spoken
words, the correct batch of reagents, and 'the powers within', which is
your own mysticism. He tends to refer to his own powerful magics as 'paltry
tricks'. Rumor has it, however, that Maleval does not believe that which
he speaks. Widow Qesino claims that she once walked into his inn room to
see him performing a Qor ritual, leading one to believe that he is just
attempting to weaken the faith of the land. Maleval shrugs these off with
a laugh, but he may have a dark spell to teach those who prove their worth.
He also has a canny insight as to why you may or may not be able to learn
a given spell. Maleval wanders from inn to tavern to inn to tavern, also
stopping at apothecary shops and also frequenting the Duke's Chambers,
who earnestly enjoys seeing Maleval's little 'shows', and the princess
fears that Maleval may tip the balance against her. Maleval has also been
sighted in the Temple of Qor from time to time, but he never visits the
others. Maleval radiates energy from beneath his copious purple robes.
A slight and dangerous smile hides beneath his black and white beard.</P>
