<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Used to working with the well refined tastes of nobility, Madelia meticulously
oversees her craft. However, she often wishes to spend excessive time working
on a single outfit for one of the most powerful and esteemed members of
court. There are rumors that she pushes off the less important projects
to teenage girls that are somewhere between apprentices and slave labor.
Madelia’s other hobby is to play with the hearts of men and currently has
four affairs in the works. She moved away from Tos years ago to get away
from a failing relationship with the hypochondriac Frisconar. Although
she considers that relationship over, he still clings and sends messages
all the time. When she is in need of free magical reagents, she responds
to them. She has been carrying on an affair of convenience with Frular
for several months now. He will never leave his wife, but at present Madelia
and Frular are attracted to one another. Eventually the fling will die
out, but both will savor it before it does. Her third relationship is with
Pritchett. He is genuinely in love with her and believes that she remains
faithful to him. She sees him as a caring and well meaning man and knows
that he would stick with her to the end, but she feels she is too young
to settle with him (or for him). Her last current fling has yet to be defined,
but will probably be with a wandering NPC. Madelia is in her early thirties
and his attractive and well dressed.</TD>
