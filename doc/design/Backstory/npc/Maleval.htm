<TR>
<TD>This tall, imposing and dark figure is notable in one way. He is the
only person in the Meridian land to insist that the Gods are merely a convenient
way to describe that which cannot be explained, which is to say magic.
He claims that magic comes from cleverly spoken words, the correct batch
of reagents, and 'the powers within', which is your own mysticism. He tends
to refer to his own powerful magics as 'paltry tricks'. Rumor has it, however,
that Maleval does not believe that which he speaks. Widow Qesino claims
that she once walked into his inn room to see him performing a Qor ritual,
leading one to believe that he is just attempting to weaken the faith of
the land. Maleval shrugs these off with a laugh, but he may have a dark
spell to teach those who prove their worth. He also has a canny insight
as to why you may or may not be able to learn a given spell. Maleval wanders
from inn to tavern to inn to tavern, also stopping at apothecary shops
and also frequenting the Duke's Chambers, who earnestly enjoys seeing Maleval's
little 'shows', and the princess fears that Maleval may tip the balance
against her. Maleval has also been sighted in the Temple of Qor from time
to time, but he never visits the others. Maleval radiates energy from beneath
his copious purple robes. A slight and dangerous smile hides beneath his
black and white beard.</TD>
