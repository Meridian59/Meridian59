<TD>No one knows what to make of Miriana. She is barely a woman, young
and innocent, and yet she is widely watched by the religious community
of Meridian. She is always barely dressed, thin, lithe, and red-haired,
and she is to be found dancing, arms outstretched to the heavens out in
the forest, anytime, day or night. Miriana is most well-known for her heretical
statements. She disputes that the Gods ever walked the earth as human (a
view which is widely scorned by all schools of Mainland meridian). She
also is well-known for her claims about the relationship of Shal'ille and
Faren, which seem to vary at random. Sometimes she claims they were twins,
other times, that they were lovers, and yet other times that they are the
same. Needless to say, mainstream Meridian laughs at these beliefs. And
yet she carries herself as if she believes it fully, appreciating the peace
and the fury of the wild. Animals leave her unmolested always. Miriana
dances in place in parts of the forest where players rarely have reason
to go. Rumor has it that the magics of both schools run freely through
Miriana. Miriana is rumored to know a new spell or two. Miriana is loathed
by Xiana because of her heretical beliefs towards Shal'ille. Qerti'nya
hates her because Miriana speaks of Kraanan with total contempt, and Tenuv'vyal
is terrified that Miriana will someday replace her. Only Zuxana treats
Miriana with respect and admiration - because she knows that Tenuv'vyal
is right. </TD>
