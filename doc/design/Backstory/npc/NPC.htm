<TD><B><A HREF="Fehr.htm">Fehr'loi Qan</A></B></TD>

<TD>Blacksmith</TD>

<TD>Though well renown throughout the land for his superb skill as a master
weapon smith, Fehr’loi Qan himself could not be considered the sharpest
sword on the rack. The large man’s slow speech seems out of place in the
high brow city of Barloque. You get the impression that he is uncomfortable
with strangers, but his great size and clear devotion to Kraanan makes
him afraid of no one.</TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#0080FF">
<TD><B><A HREF="Frular.htm">Frular</A></B></TD>

<TD>Guildmaster</TD>

<TD>Before you stands the stately guild hall executor. Frular has made
a healthy profit off selling official guild titles, maintenance of their
charters and the leasing of guild halls. </TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#0080FF">
<TD><B><A HREF="Herbutte.htm">Herbutte</A></B></TD>

<TD>Gem Shop</TD>

<TD>Fancying himself a connoisseur of the finer things, Herbutte is little
more than a old school aristocratic snob. Within him is a dark streak of
contempt for nearly all save royalty. He will never run out of bad things
to say about the other towns and the low life transients that wander between
them. </TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#0080FF">
<TD><B><A HREF="Joguer.htm">Joguer</A></B></TD>

<TD>Herb Shop</TD>

<TD>Whistling an inane tune to himself, Joguer takes great care in tending
to his fresh garden of magical herbs and mushrooms. Many say he is the
foremost herbalist in the land.</TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#0080FF">
<TD><B><A HREF="Meidei.htm">Meidei</A></B></TD>

<TD>Bartender</TD>

<TD>At one time Meidei only served the rich or those who tipped well, until
recently when he &quot;found&quot; Shal’ille. Now a hard core believer,
he almost drives his own customers away from his ale.</TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#0080FF">
<TD><B><A HREF="Pritchett.htm">Pritchett</A></B></TD>

<TD>Innkeeper</TD>

<TD>Of everyone in Barloque, the former sailor turned innkeeper Pritchett
is the least haughty. Perhaps it is because he was not from the Royal City
and recently moved to North Barloque to buy a title.</TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#0080FF">
<TD><B><A HREF="Roq.htm">Roq</A></B></TD>

<TD>Assassin</TD>

to the shadows of this vile place, a servant to some dark power.</TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#FF80C0">
<TD><B><A HREF="Saidi.htm">Caramo</A></B></TD>

<TD>City Clerk</TD>

<TD>Not your typical Royal bureaucrat. She's attractive, charming, and
by all accounts, honorable. Caramo has spent years counting the Duke's
money, filing the former Queen's taxation scrolls, and more recently, serving
as clerk for the Office of the Justicar. </TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#0080FF">
<TD><B><A HREF="Obert.htm">Obert Cair'bre</A></B></TD>

<TD>Vaultman</TD>

<TD>Obert is a relatively handsome gentleman who takes almost as much of
pride in his vaults are he does in his family. His professional manner
shows that he realizes his customers are often in a hurry to retrieve their
goods. </TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#FF80C0">
<TD><B><A HREF="Madelia.htm">Madelia</A></B></TD>

<TD>Tailor</TD>

<TD>Used to working with the well refined tastes of nobility, Madelia meticulously
oversees her craft. However, she often wishes to spend excessive time working
on a single outfit for one of the more powerful and esteemed members of
court. Madelia’s other hobby is to play with the hearts of men and currently
has several affairs in the works. </TD>

<TD>Afiera D’xor spent many, many years of solitude in these mountains,

meditation.</TD>

his job. </TD>

<TD><B><A HREF="Ran.htm">Ran er'Hoth</A></B></TD>

<TD>Wise Man</TD>

<TD>An ancient member of the Marion community, Ran er’Hoth has taken on
a somewhat legendary status throughout Meridian, and is sought out for
his opinions and knowledge by pilgrims and travelers. Whether he is considered
a wise man or the village idiot locally really depends on who you talk
to.</TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#0080FF">
<TD><B><A HREF="Tova.htm">Tova</A></B></TD>

<TD>Bartender</TD>

<TD>Healer</TD>

<TD>Magic Shop</TD>

<TD>This sickly man stares at you with bleary eyes from behind the counter.
His breathing is somewhat labored and sweat mattes his forehead. Frisconar

is for his dour out look on life.</TD>

<TR BGCOLOR="#0080FF">
<TD><B><A HREF="Paddock.htm">Paddock</A></B></TD>

<TD>Bartender</TD>

<TD>As owner of perhaps the most popular bar in the world, Paddock goes

<TD><B><A HREF="Rycksher.htm">Rycksher</A></B></TD>

<TD>Councilor</TD>

<TD>A wise physician, he is rumored to have perfected his body’s healing

<TD>Kraanan</TD>

<TD>Qerti’nya is very judgmental of the strength of those who come before
her. Blood and hellfire are the tools of this priestess, for only the strong

Although she delivers a powerful sermon, she is likely to go out drinking
with the men after it is over.</TD>

ko’Manca is serious and crisp in his duties. In peacetime these duties
include supervising the main gatehouse during daylight against actions
by enemies unknown. Cital ko’Manca is extraordinarily young to have achieved
such a high rank, but he is well respected for his fairness and his adherence
to military law.</TD>

ko’Ixca is a tough veteran of many campaigns. His peacetime duties include
supervising the main gatehouse during the night hours against actions by
enemies unknown, and since this is a time of relative peace part of Xacal

<TD>An older man who is obviously blind in both eyes. With his every move
exacting and his every word said with forethought, this former warrior
defines the slow grace of a seasoned hunter. Noted for his keen ear, some

thought.</TD>

<TD>Minstrel</TD>

<TD>Parrin is widely known across the land, but rarely spoken of favorably.
Although extremely gifted with the lyre, this traveling minstrel’s lyrics
and puns habitually bring groans of disgust from those who are forced to
listen. Rumor has it that Paddock has threatened to kill Parrin should
he ever set foot in Familiars again. For a generous tip, he may sing of
