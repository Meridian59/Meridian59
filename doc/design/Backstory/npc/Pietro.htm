<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Twelve years ago this tavern was a profitable and bustling business,
serving drinks and food to the never ending shifts of hard-pan miners coming
from and going back to work in the shafts sunk deep into these jagged hills,
and the money flowed freely. In those days you might have described Pietro
as a sullen man, irritable even, who conducted business on terse terms
and liked to take a nip behind the bar. But ten years ago the ore dried
up, and the miners moved on and took the prosperity with them. They left
behind a ghost town inhabited by the same superstitious, wary mountain
folk who had existed here before the mines and will be here forever. And
the last decade hasn't served to improve Pietro's attitude much, or his
drinking. Now you could describe him as peevish and inflammatory, a suspicious
man, and a mean drunk. He carves a bleak existence out serving the few
travelers looking for a safe port in these mountains, but that's fine with
him, because he doesn't have patience for people and their incessant chatter.
He sulks behind the bar pretending to look occupied when strangers come
in, generally answering questions with a movement from his head, a shrug
of his shoulders, or a grunt. If a stranger isn't ordering, they aren't
welcome. He is of medium height, in his early forties, and razor thin with
black hair pulled back tight into a pony tail. His face is sallow, pock
marked, and shows the effects of heavy drinking. He dresses for the mountains,
perhaps a woolen vest, heavy shirt, no hat. He does not make eye contact.</TD>
