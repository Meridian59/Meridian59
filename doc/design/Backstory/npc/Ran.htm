<TD>Wise man or village idiot? It really depends upon who you talk to.
Ran er'Hoth is an old (bordering on ancient) member of the Marion community
who has taken on a somewhat legendary status in the other areas of Meridian,
and is sought out for his opinions and knowledge by pilgrims and travelers.
The good people of Marion do their best to ignore him, because in their
minds he has cried wolf just one too many times. Generations ago and for
many years he was a fairly successful seer to the local population. By
taking his signs from the more ancient practices of studying the intestines
of herd animals, the thickness of an onions' skin, the color of the rings
around the moon and the like, Ran er'Hoth could predict with some accuracy
weather, seasons, crop yields, and other events of practical significance
to this agrarian community. He established himself and enjoyed the support
of the citizens, but was renown only locally. Then about twenty years ago
he lost it, though unbeknownst to the township, who fled to the mountains
after he predicted a flood of water that would swallow the houses and cover
the earth. They returned to Marion weeks later to find their herds and
fields in shambles, from neglect not water, and their reputation as Meridians
most thick headed and gullible people solidly reinforced. Then he predicted
a termite epidemic that never panned out, but he got all the Marionites
to spread dung over any exposed wood on their houses and tools to protect
them. More laughter and jeers from the big city and mountain folk. This
was followed by a supposed turnip famine, the foretelling of a fire-breathing
pig that would kill anything in its' path, a non-existent sandstorm, and
the vision of a rebellion by the people of Jasper, all of which the good
people of Marion reacted to accordingly. Meanwhile an unforeseen early
frost followed directly by unseasonable spring rains ruined the harvest,
and that was it for the old man. He left the village to walk the land a
pauper, none of the locals would believe him any longer. His prophetic
ramblings went on through his self-imposed exile, and strangely, he began
to make sense (in the most abstract terms) to some element of the people
he encountered and drew a following. He returned to the village five years
ago and all had been forgiven, the locals bring food and water to his hut,
and people come from all over the land to visit him for guidance. In a
small town like Marion this qualifies as a full blown tourist attraction,
and he's actually good for the local economy. He is withered and hunched
with wisps of white hair and the furious eyes of a lunatic. He might be
dresses like a homeless man, layers of worn clothing.</TD>
