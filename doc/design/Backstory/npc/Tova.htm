<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>A boisterous and bellowing man who takes life as it comes through the
door of The Limping Toad, serving drinks and telling a never ending stream
of jokes to the local farmhands and occasional traveler. Tova is open and
congenial; the warmth of his public house matches his ruddy smile and huge
strong belly, the result of thirty-five years of working and drinking at
his thriving, if somewhat slower paced, pub. He pokes fun at Meridian's
different cities and their inhabitants in an attempt to get a laugh out
of his customers, but he especially makes fun of Marionites. His best audience
however, is Morrigan who idolizes the man and laughs at everything he says,
or even what he imagines Tova might say. Tova is tall, broad, and smiling
in shirt sleeves and a leather apron. His pub is renown for it's powerful
stout.</TD>
