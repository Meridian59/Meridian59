<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Until very recently Qesino ran the inn in Jasper, with Mrs. Qesino
in the background. That is to say, Qesino sat behind the counter and greeted
the infrequent guest, counted the money and fretted about all the business
he felt he was missing out on, while Mrs. Qesino was up before dawn to
start the fire, do the baking, the sweeping, scrub the floors, get Qesinos'
breakfast, do the shopping, split and stack the firewood, make the beds,
and on, and on. After fifteen years of this, guess what happened next?
Qesino left the inn one morning, some months back, on one of his periodic
business trips to Tos (he never trusted Yevitan, at the Jasper bank) and
he disappeared. Never showed up in Tos, never came back to Jasper. Supposedly
had a bunch of gold with him too, hidden, but that never showed up either.
At first there were a few rumors, Jasper being a small town and all that
implies; maybe an avalanche, someone said, or a troll was another theory.
But then two weeks after Qesinos' disappearance (the search parties were
just returning) Quintor the blacksmith moved into the inn and people in
Jasper just quit talking about it altogether. Funny thing about the mountains,
rocks are always falling on things, covering them up. There's a lot of
stuff that goes missing, and you'll just never see again. So the Widow
Qesino takes care of the inn, like before, but now she counts the money
too. She is in her late thirties, heavy set, straightforward. She will
gladly rent you a room or feed you, but the pleasantries are kept to a
minimum. She might wear a shawl; she's industrious and busy, makes time
for a curt hello to everyone in town. It's hard to tell if anyone noticed,
but she didn't cry at the wake.</TD>
