<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>Zhieu B'hob is probably the only citizen of Jasper who actually is
excited to see players in town. The reason is simple, he wants to see his
business thrive. Even so, his excitement is only relative to the rest of
the Jasper folk, he just shares a little less of the guarded skepticism
that seems a hallmark of the citizens here. He is cordial and friendly
though, politely administering to the needs of his customers. Zhieu B'hob
is of medium height and build and is young in appearance. He could wear
a sweater and dark woolen vest. He has made himself responsible for feeding
and clothing Afiera D'xor, and some say that he is the wise man's secret
pupil.</TD>
