    <p><b>Client side</b></p>
    <p>Players can log in to a guest account in two ways. First, the
      setting
      "Guest=1" can appear in the [Miscellaneous] section of the
      meridian.ini
      file. In this case, the client attempts to log in immediately
      after the
      title screen; the login dialog does not appear. Second, the user
      can type
      "guest" as his account name, with any password.</p>
    <p>When a player tries to log in as a guest, the client picks a
      server
      number uniformly at random from the closed interval given by the
      "ServerLow"
      and "ServerHigh" entries in the [Miscellaneous] section of the
      meridian.ini file. If the server responds that the login is
      allowed, the
      player continues to log in and create his character as usual. If,
      however,
      the server responds that the login is not allowed (for example, if
      there
      are too many guests on the server), the client picks another
      server number
      and tries again. In either case, the server can include as part of
      its
      response a new closed interval of server numbers, which replace
      the "ServerLow"
      and "ServerHigh" values in the client's ini file. This is how
      we can dynamically change the servers we use for guest accounts.</p>
    <p>In addition to the above scheme, the client keeps track of the
      last
      server number it connected to, and attempts to log in to that
      server first.
      The purpose of this is to have guests reconnect to the same server
      if they
      lose connection for some reason.</p>
    <p>While the client is attempting to log in as a guest, a small
      dialog
      displays a message and a progress bar. The progress bar counts the
      number
      of attempted logins; the client stops trying after 20 logins and
      displays
      a message that all servers are full.</p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p><b>Server side</b></p>
    <p>Three keys in the [Guest] section of the blakserv.cfg file
      control guest
      logins. The "Max" key specifies the number of simultaneous guest
      logins that the server accepts. The "ServerMin" and "ServerMax"
      keys give the range of server numbers the client should try to
      contact
      for guest logins (these correspond to the client's "ServerLow and
      ServerHigh" numbers above). The server's default values for this
      section
      look as follows:</p>
    <dd><tt>[Guest]</tt></dd>
    <dd><tt>Max 30</tt></dd>
    <dd><tt>ServerMin 55</tt></dd>
    <dd><tt>ServerHigh 58</tt></dd>
    <p>These settings can be changed dynamically with the "set config"
      administrator command. Any changes should be saved by also issuing
      the
      "save config" command.</p>
    <p>When a server encounters a login with the account name "guest",
      it attempts to assign the login to the first available guest
      account. At
      present (1/25/97), there are no guest accounts on the commercial
      servers,
      so these need to be created---at least as many accounts as the
      "Max"
      setting in the blakserv.cfg file. These accounts are created with
      the "create
      account guest" administrator mode command.</p>

    <p><b>Game play</b></p>
    <p>Guests log in to a special section of the game world that is not
      connected
      with the area containing paying customers. In character creation,
      they
      do not have a choice of spells or skills; they always start with
      the fireball
      spell and the slash skill.</p>
    <p>Guests cannot broadcast, or "tell" to anyone outside the guest
      area. They cannot send or receive mail. When a guest dies, he is
      restored
      to the place he first appeared upon login. There is no way out
      from the
      guest area to the outside world.</p>

    <p><b>Updating guest clients</b></p>
    <p>Guest clients should be updated as rarely as possible, since
      guest installations
      may circulate long after we distribute them. However, whenever we
      update
      the commercial customers, guest customers will probably always
      need at
      least a small update. The files that guests need should be
      collected in
      a separate package, and this package must be marked in the
      server's packages.txt
      file by adding 32 to the package type number. This signals the
      client that
      it needs to download the package even if it is logging in as a
      guest.</p>
