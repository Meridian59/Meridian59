<h1>Timestamps and Related Bugs<br>
</h1>

<h2> Purpose:</h2>
This document details an old bug in the system dealing with timestamps
and variable overflows.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<h2>Basics</h2>
The server provides timestamps to the scripting system which uses it
for various aspects of the game.&nbsp; Unfortunately, due to Blakod's
limitation on maximum integer size, this causes overflows on a regular
basis and causes problems with the game.<br>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Getting a timestamp</h3>
The scripting system can get a timestamp from the server by calling the
function <span style="font-style: italic;">GetTime()</span>.&nbsp;
Originally, this returned the normal system time, which is the number
of seconds since 1970.&nbsp; Unfortunately, due to the limitations on
the <a href="Blakod%20notes.htm#maxint">maximum integer value</a> able
to be stored by Blakod, the value of the timestamp is too large to
store in a script variable.<br>
<h3>The solution</h3>
The temporary solution has been to adjust the values returned by the
function to the script system.&nbsp; This is accomplished in the file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">\blakston\blakserv\ccode.c </span>on
line 2045.&nbsp; Currently we subtract the long integer value of
1148678128L, which puts timestamp 0 sometime in the month of May,
2006.&nbsp; This fix will work until the new timestamp value overflows
the maximum integer value, which will happen in approximiately 4 years
and 3 months.<br>
<br>
Likewise, the client has to recalculate timestamps passed to it.&nbsp;
Currently this only affecs globe posts and mail message
timestamps.&nbsp; This value is set in file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">\blakston\module\mailnews\newsread.c</span>
on line 372.&nbsp;&nbsp; The value should match the one set in the
server above.&nbsp; This code goes into the mailnews.dll client file.<br>
<h3>Systems affected by the bug</h3>
Currently, there are a few systems that use timestamps and that will be
affected by this bug.&nbsp; They include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Globe spam timer: users will be unable to post on the globes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Suicide timer: users will be unable to suicide characters.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Mule casting timer: unguilded innocents cannot cast on others.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Globe post and new mail message timestamps will show an incorrect
date.</li>
</ul>
The following systems are also affected, but can be fixed by doing <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">"send class user UpdateTimeValues</span>"
at the server console or admin window.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Double death check in player: will prevent users from properly
dying.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Guild rejoin time: will preventing users from rejoining a guild.</li>
</ul>
Adjusting the values above should fix all problems except for the
timestamps on globe posts and mail messages.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these
will always have incorrect dates when the times are adjusted.<br>
<br>
Note that existing mail messages on the client have their timestamps
converted into dates when they are downloaded.<br>
<h3>Future directions</h3>
Unfortunately, it is easy to forget that we currently have a temporary
fix.&nbsp; This means the bug will become active again and require the
change of the variables mentioned above.&nbsp; It would be nice to have
a solution that does not require recompiling the server and&nbsp; a
client DLL.<br>
<br>
A proposed solution:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Have a configuration variable in blakserv.cfg that contains the
offset required.&nbsp; This can be adjusted at server startup.&nbsp;
Perhaps have the system give a warning if the current offset will
expire within a few months.&nbsp; Alternatively: the server could
calculate an offset every time it starts up; this seems like overkill
since the bug only strikes once every 4 years or so.&nbsp; This
alternative would also create problems with the time stamps on globe
postings if they are older than the offset.</li>
  <li>The scripting system would have to notified when the value is
changed so that it can adjust stored timestamps appropriately.<br>
  </li>
  <li>As part of the login handshake, the server can pass the current
offset to the client.&nbsp; The client stores this value and uses it to
offset any timestamps sent to it.</li>
  <li>Globe postings and mail messages could use strings for timestamps
instead of integers.&nbsp; This would increase the amount of bandwidth
required to send the information.&nbsp; This could cause problems,
since a large amount of mail messages can knock a person offline; using
strings would reduce the number of messages that could be passed at one
time<br>
  </li>
</ul>
