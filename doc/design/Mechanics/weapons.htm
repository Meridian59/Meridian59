    <h1>Weapons of Meridian</h1>
    This document explains how weapons work in Dark Auspices. The
    specifics will probably change in future releases, but the general
    concept should remain the same.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Motivation for changing Weapons</h2>
    Weapons were changed due to the lack of variety of weapons that
    people
    used. This system encourages a wider variety of weapons to be used.
    In
    future iterations, monsters may become more resistant to certain
    types
    of weapon damage.
    <p> </p>
    <h3>The general information:</h3>
    Weapons are separated into three types. Bludgeoning weapons are all
    non-bladed weapons, like hammer. Thrusting weapons refer to various
    types of swords. Slashing weapons are the heavier weapons like Axe
    and
    Scimitar. The general characteristics of the weapons are described
    in
    this table:
    <p>

          <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>To-Hit Modifier</th>
            <th>Range of Damage</th>

    <p> <strong>To-Hit modifier</strong> is the bonus a wielder has
      with the
      weapon. This helps compensate for low skill in a weapon, or helps
      skilled players hit harder monsters. </p>
    <p> <strong>Range of Damage</strong> indicates the general amount
      of
      damage a weapon will do. </p>
    <p> <strong>Disarm Bonus</strong> indicates the bonus a player with
      the
      disarm skill receives to his or her disarm attempts. A higher
      bonus
      gives a better chance for the skill to work and a better chance to
      make
      the opponent drop his or her weapon. Note that this does not
      affect
      people without the disarm skill. </p>
    <p> <strong>Spell "Penalty"</strong> refers to the amount a weapon
      interferes with spellcasting. A high value in this category is
      good,
      meaning that it will interfere with spellcasting less. With a few
      exceptions, wielding a weapon will decrease a player's
      spellcasting
      ability. </p>
    <p> <strong>Reach of Weapon</strong> is how far the weapon can
      reach.
      This needs to be tweaked a bit due to the wierd way that Meridian
      calculates "distance". </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>Values</h3>
    These are the hard numbers behind the weapon characteristics:
    <p>
      <table border="1">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>To-Hit Modifier</th>
            <th>Range of Damage</th>
            <th>Disarm Bonus</th>
            <th>Spell "Penalty"</th>
            <th>Reach of Weapon</th>
          </tr>
          <tr align="center">
            <td>Low</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>3-8</td>
            <td>-5</td>
            <td>-30</td>
            <td>2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr align="center">
            <td>Mid</td>
            <td>75</td>
            <td>4-8</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>-10</td>
            <td>2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr align="center">
            <td>High</td>
            <td>175</td>
            <td>4-9</td>
            <td>20<br>
            </td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>3</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p> Ideally, these would be the only numbers we would have to tweak
      in
      order to balance weapons again. </p>
    <p> Originally, the values for Reach were- Low: 3, Mid: 4, High: 5.
      This
      made the ranges for mid and high MUCH too long. These values will
      be
      tweaked in the future as the combat system is reworked. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>Quality modifications</h3>
    Weapons also come in different qualities. Higher quality weapons are
    generally better, except for the spell "penalty". Better quality
    weapons tend to lower spell power more, while low quality weapons
    don't
    hurt your casting ability as much.

            <td>0</td>

            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p> Base number of hits: 250-300 </p>
    <p> Ideally, it would be nice to have lower quality weapons have a
      -1 to
      reach, but this would make the mace a weapon with a range of one.
      It
      sucks bad enough already.... </p>
    <p> Normal quality is just that, "normal". It's the baseline for the
      weapon type. </p>
    <p> Note that nerudite can be considered a "quality" of weapon. This
      way, we can add new material types which give bonuses and
      penalties to
      these areas. Examples are magic hating materials that give large
      penalties to spell casting (and perhaps do extra damage vs.
      spellcasters), magic-aiding weapons (that give bonuses to
      spellpower,
      extra to-hit to compensate for low weapon skills, etc). </p>

    <h3>Other notes<br>
    </h3>
    Spiritual Hammer is a bit special, since it's summoned.&nbsp; It
    cannot
    be damaged, and it gives no penalty to spellcasting given it's
    magical
    nature.&nbsp; It also has Shal'ille and Kraanan ("magic") attributes
    on
    it by default.&nbsp; It cannot be swapped, shattered, or
    enchanted.&nbsp; It also gives a slight bonus to-hit based on the
    power
    of the spell that summoned it.&nbsp; It lasts for a limited duration
    and
    disappears after that duration is up.<br>
    <br>
    Mystic swords have the Kraanan ("magic") attribute by default, and
    are
    not on the random magical weapon table.<br>

    <p> Touch attacks use the base damage above, picks a value between
      the
      two values, inclusive. The attack then does (50 + (Spell
      Power/2))% of
      that damage. Spell Power ranges from 0 to 100 and is determined
      when
      the spell is cast. </p>
    <p> Note that Holy Touch does a bonus of -(Target's Karma)% in
      damage.
      So, a target with -100 Karma will suffer an extra 100% damage,
      while
      someone with a 50 Karma will take 50% less damage. It also does
      50%
      more damage to Undead (including Necromancers). </p>

    <h2>Miscellaneous Notes</h2>
    <p>Swords of the Hunt are high-quality thrusting weapons. </p>
    <p> Riija swords are high-quality thrusting weapons but only require
      Short Sword Fighting as a skill.&nbsp; They give a bonus to Riija
      spells
      (about +10, and only -10 to non-Riija spells instead of the normal
      -15).
      They are also MUCH more durable, having 600-650 hits instead of
      the
      normal amount. Reasonable for a quest item. </p>
    <p> Gold swords are normal quality thrusting weapons, just like
      longswords, except they only do 2-5 points of damage normally, but
      do +7
      extra points of damage in Arenas. </p>
