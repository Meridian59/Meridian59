<P><B><FONT SIZE=+4>Necromancer Entrance Puzzle 
<HR WIDTH="100%">Part 1</FONT></B> 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B>Located in G9, 'an ancient place, its origin forgotten'.</B></P>

<P><B>Backstory:</B></P>

<P>This is the ancient arena of Brax, the dark twin of the Tos arena. While
the Tos arena is dedicated to Kraanan and exists to glorify honorable combat,
the Brax arena was dedicated to Qor, and existed to glorify the senseless
slaughter of helpless victims. After hundreds of years of disuse since
the city's fall, some of the arena's enchantments have weakened and drained
away, but for the most part it still works.</P>

<P>Players will find a first-hand account of the horrors of the arena of
Brax, either written in a tome somewhere on the mainland or in the Bards'
Tales of Adventure (TBD). Brendon will craft this creepy bit of prose,
but it will be along these lines:</P>

<UL>
<P><I>I was disguised as a necromancer, hidden in the crowd standing on
the center platform of the arena of Brax. The Evil Queen raised her hands
to the roiling clouds above, and a bolt of lightning slammed down into
the central pillar. The earth shook, there was the sound of stone grating
against stone, I struggled through the crowd to see what was going on below.
I was thrown back as more lighting struck, once, twice, thrice, maybe more,
then I managed to break through to the edge of the platform just as I felt
it begin to rise. Far below the stands, the unarmed, helpless victims huddled
together, terrified. A horde of deformed skeletal warriors swarmed into
view, and with an inhuman cry descended upon the humans, tearing them limb
from limb as the necromancers cackled with glee. I shuddered and withdrew
from the gruesome spectacle below, vowing that I would see this abomination
destroyed.</I></P>

<P><B>This is all the information the players will receive.</B></P>

<P>Since the puzzle will be deactivated for the beta testers, our in-house
testers are the only ones who will actually be testing this puzzle. As
such, they should use only this information until they have figured out
the puzzle for the first time. I want to be sure that it's not impossible
to figure out, after all.</P>

<P>Once you've solved it, <A HREF="necpuzz2.htm">here are the spoilers</A>
so that you can test it more rigorously.</P>
