<P><B><FONT SIZE=+3>What does the Necromancer/Hunter scenario mean in Happyland?</FONT></B></P>

<P>After all, it pretty much centers around PKing!</P>

<P>Allow me to propose four possible scenarios:</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Scenario One: Nobody Nowhere</FONT></B></P>

<P>No Necromancer Amulets and no Hunter Swords ever generate. The Lich
Queen remains as a boss creature. She regenerates via a timer like the
Lupogg King or the Orc Pit Boss. She still teaches spells to evil kids,
as does Tendrath, but they no longer require amulets/swords to teach. Extra
monster generation points get added to the maze. The maze randomly cycles
through its possible configurations when the Lich regenerates, but the
levers and cameras are still hooked up so the players can make fun mazes
to challenge each other while they're waiting for Venya'cyr to reawaken.</P>

<UL>
<P>advantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Relatively low kod impact, since amulet, sword, guild code don't even
need to be touched.</LI>
</UL>

<P>disadvantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>it will become necessary to fork the NPC dialog database, since Tendrath
and the Lich can no longer make any references to the amulets or swords.</LI>

<LI>players get gypped of all the neat amulet/sword features, plus role-play
opportunities.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Scenario Two: Necromancer Lite</FONT></B></P>

<P>Necromancer amulets and Hunter Swords generate as normal. Hunters and
necromancers must subsist upon monster kills (this will probably involve
rebalancing the nourishment scale). Necromancers can form the guild by
reawakening the lich as normal. Necromancers may disband the guild due
to nonpayment of tithe, without the usual penalties. If someone kills the
lich, the guild is disbanded and all amulets/swords detonate, but hunters
and necromancers suffer no ill effects aside from something minor such
as a red translate.</P>

<UL>
<P>advantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Very low kod impact.</LI>

<LI>Preserves the bulk of the scenario intact, especially the role-play
elements.</LI>
</UL>

<P>disadvantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>feels a little bit on the weak side.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Scenario Three: Getting warmer...</FONT></B></P>

<P>Necromancer amulets and Hunter Swords generate as normal. Hunters and
necromancers must subsist upon monster kills (this will probably involve
rebalancing the nourishment scale). Necromancers can form the guild by
reawakening the lich as normal. Necromancers suffer the usual penalty for
disbanding the guild due to nonpayment of tithe. If someone kills the lich,
the effects are also as usual.</P>

<UL>
<P>advantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>no kod impact at all (aside from tweaking some hunger numbers in the
Amulets and Swords)</LI>

<LI>Preserves the bulk of the scenario intact.</LI>
</UL>

<P>disadvantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>allows players an avenue to hurt each other, which is against the philosophy
of Happyland.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Scenario Four: You asked for it, you got it.</FONT></B></P>

<P>Everything about the necromancer scenario remains intact. That is to
say, if you use an amulet or a sword you are choosing to allow your character
to kill and be killed by other pkers. Hunters and Necromancers may only
attack Hunters or Necromancers.</P>

<UL>
<P>advantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>very low kod impact.</LI>
</UL>

<P>disadvantages:</P>

<UL>
<LI>What about all the pk-oriented spells which are no longer available?
Can't add them just for these characters, because that would screw up advancement
for everyone. pretty lame.</LI>

<LI>having pkable and nonpkable characters in the same server is asking
for trouble. (Damion would shit a brick!)</LI>

<LI>seems to be basically against the whole point of Happyland.</LI>
