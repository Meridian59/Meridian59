<P><B>Tendrath</B></P>

<P>Ghost of a wise old man. Earthy, natural, a mage, Medium solid build,
White hair, beard, adequate warrior, not frail</P>

<P>Game Role:</P>

<P>Tendrath is a ghost who wanders from place to place (like maleval, miriana,
etc), usually appearing in out-of the way places such as deep forests,
the cragged mountains (near the entrance to the Necropolis), and occasionally
in the Necropolis itself. He provides players with much of the backstory
(who is Venya'cyr, what was Brax), as well as telling players where to
find the Sword of the Hunt and how to destroy the Lich. He also teaches
a number of new Faren and Kraanan spells (some only to Hunters).</P>

<P>Character history: </P>

<P>Family was killed by Venya’cyr. The overriding goal of his life was
to destroy the evil that took his family from him. He is a bit stubborn,
slightly bitter but very driven in his cause. He is not open minded on
many subjects but has a keen mind. He could be considered a tactician,
he is certainly a craftsman. He is a common man whose life was inexorably
changed by “fate”. He views fate as a chaotic force and to counter this
force he seeks order through discipline, devotion and a strong code of
living. The subject of his family brings the old man to tears or outrage
against the Queen Lich.</P>
