<P><FONT SIZE=-1>[Draft 1: Oct 9, 97]</FONT></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<HR WIDTH="100%"><B>Necromancer Amulet</B></P>

<P>One of the centerpieces of the Necromancer/Hunter scenario (see the
design overview).</P>

<P>A silver chain with a large circular pendant. The pendant is engraved
with the symbol of the Order of Necromancers (which in turn derives from
the mythology of the Three Witches, see the discussion of the symbol),
and is color-translatable in order to provide a visual indicator of the
player's hunger level.</P>

<P>art needs:</P>

<UL>
<LI>inventory/look view, with color translatable pendant.</LI>

<LI>dropped one-view.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><B>Sword of the Hunt</B></P>

<P>One of the centerpieces of the Necromancer/Hunter scenario.</P>

<P>A sword about the same size as a longsword, the hilt formed of intertwined
vines clutching a color-translatable gem which indicates hunger level.</P>

<P>art needs:</P>

<UL>
<LI>inventory/look view, with color-translatable gem.</LI>

<LI>dropped one-view.</LI>

<LI>third-person player overlay, six views plus attack animations.</LI>

<LI>first-person window overlay, animated.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><B>Maze lever</B></P>

<P>The levers which control the walls of the Lich's maze. Each lever is
attached to a wall at about chest-height, and sticks out perpendicular
to the wall. The lever switches vertically (up/down) and has two positions.
The end of the lever is color-translatable, so that levers can be color-coded
to help players remember them.</P>

<P>art needs:</P>

<UL>
<LI>third-person view, 3 views (front, left side, right side) plus one
blank back view (can't see it from the back, it's attached to a wall).</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><B>Maze scrying globe</B></P>

<P>The crystal balls which allow players to spy on the maze. Four of these
(for viewing into) are placed inside the lich's inner sanctum, and four
more in the maze (for viewing out of). They are simple glass or crystal
globes which float in midair a little below head-height.</P>

<P>art needs:</P>

<UL>
<LI>third-person one-view.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><B>Generic wands (2 items)</B></P>

<P>Two generic wands with a color-translatable band or gem or some such
doo-dad. These will be used for the wands which enact different spell effects.</P>

<P>art needs:</P>

<UL>
<LI>inventory/look view, with color-translatable element.</LI>

<LI>dropped one-view, with color-translatable element.</LI>

<LI>broken inventory/look/dropped view, with color translatable element.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><B>Generic scroll</B></P>

<P>One generic scroll with a color-translatable ribbon. This will be used
for scrolls which enact existing spell effects. The existing scroll art
will serve well for this, except for the 'open' view, which should have
some sort of squiggly creepy spidery mystical-looking writing on the inside
of the unrolled scroll.</P>

<P>art needs:</P>

<UL>
<LI>look view, scroll open (different from inventory/dropped views).</LI>
</UL>
