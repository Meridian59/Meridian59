<H1><B>Art List (First Draft)</B></H1>

<H3><B>Monsters</B></H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>New</B></LI>

<UL>
<LI><I><B>Avars </B>are an aboriginal race of flightless bird people. They
have simple tool-making capacity, but are very limited in regards to other
technology, such as language. They tend to be stout and neckless, and their
forelimbs resemble feathered arms more than wings. They favor spears for
weapons, and some wear a bandolier across their chest. Perhaps they have
different colored plumage.</I></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Avar Warrior - stand, walk, attack.</LI>

<LI>Avar Shaman - stand, walk, attack, cast spells. Needs projectile.</LI>

<LI>Avar Chieftain - stand, walk, attack.</LI>
</UL>

<LI><I><B>Shadowbeasts </B>are dark, nearly transparent things with red
luminent eyes. &nbsp;Wherever they go, they make the room darker, thus
making themselves almost impossible to see. They are large but lowset creatures,
walking on hind legs with knuckles that touch the ground, but are hairless,
and have razorsharp teeth.</I></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Shadowbeast - stand, walk, attack.</LI>
</UL>

<LI><I><B>Shatterlings </B>are spiky, mineral based monsters which attack
by shooting slivers of stone at you. They're exterior is smooth and sleek.
When you kill a bigling, it breaks into four littlelings. Should three
littlelings meet each other, they form a bigling. See Ed Halley for more
details. The Shatterlings will be found in the jungle and/or </I></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Bigling - stand, shoot&nbsp;(attack). Needs projectile. XLATable.</LI>

<LI>Littleling - stand, shoot, scuttle. Looks like a smaller version of
bigling. &nbsp;Needs projectile. &nbsp;XLATable.</LI>
</UL>

<LI><I><B>Dragonflies </B>are pet-sized dragons which hover off of the
ground. They come in a variety of colors, and look like large salamanders,
but their gossamer, insect-like wings (long and narrow like a real dragonfly)
are what keep them aloft. Doing something to a dragonfly may make it a
pet (i.e. it will follow you around and defend you). The Dragonflies will
be found on Konima's Island.</I></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Dragonfly - hover, fly, breathe.</LI>
</UL>

<LI><I><B>Orcs </B>already exist in the game, but we want to flesh out
the society. &nbsp;They are still barely civilized, preferring scimitars
to any other weapon, and dressing in disgusting rags. New orcs need to
match the feel of the current orc, or the current orc needs to be updated
to match. The new orcs can be found in the Orc Warrens, and the wizard
and warlord may also be used for the orc raids.</I></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Cave Orc - stand, walk, attack</LI>

<LI>Orc Wizard - stand, walk, attack, Spellcast with staff. Needs projectile.</LI>

<LI>Orc Warlord - stand, walk, attack. Carries (and attacks with) a scimitar
in each hand.</LI>
</UL>

<LI><I><B>Ghouls </B>are extremely high-levelled undead. They look very
freshly dead. They have one special power, and that is to raise any corpses
they run across into fresh ghouls. Ghouls are found in the caves of the
Orc Warrens.</I></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Ghoul - stand, walk, attack, raise dead (raise arms in air).</LI>
</UL>

<LI><I><B>Lupogg King </B>is a four or six legged version of the Lupogg
that's already in game. It's insanely tough, and has a new element, a missile
weapon, which it can fire at you to blind you. </I></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Lupogg King - stand, walk, attack, shoot (needs projectile).</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<LI><B>Repair</B></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Centipede - possibly should be replaced altogether.</LI>

<LI>Skeleton </LI>

<LI>Yeti - the animation needs serious work</LI>

<LI>Orc - needs side and rear attacking views.</LI>

<LI>Ent - needs to be in deeper resolution.</LI>

<LI>Cow - low priority, but would be much nicer if it looked good.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>NPCs</H3>

<P><I>In general, any NPC that does not engage in combat does not need
multiple views. However, their low-resolution faces look extremely poor.
Proposed standard: any NPC which does not fight </I></P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Has one view</I></LI>

<LI><I>Possibly is animated in that view, either a constant animation (like
a prayer animation) or an occasional animation (wiping the bar).</I></LI>

<LI><I>Uses character faces for it's face art, which are in higher resolution.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Has skin tones drawn in grey scale, which we can XLAT to their proper
colors.</I></LI>
</UL>

<P><I>Another thing to keep in mind is that most of the NPCs that are drawn
will be used multiple times, and therefore, while they should look good,
they should not be overly distinctive.</I></P>
