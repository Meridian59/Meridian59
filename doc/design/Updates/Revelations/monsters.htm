<UL>
<LI>Good in karma (20).</LI>

<LI>Non-aggressive to humans.</LI>

<LI>Four types of orcs</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Orc (level 45). These are the orcs that are found in the outside world
(and are referred to by the design team sometimes as 'forest orcs). Needs
walking, standing, and fighting animations, corpse view.</LI>

<LI>Cave Orc (level 70). Poorly garbed, cowardly, not very intelligent.
These orcs do most of the work in the underground orc society. When threatened,
they tend to find allies and defend each other with their working implements
(crudely hewn pickaxes). Needs walking, standing, and swing pickaxe/fighting,
corpse view.</LI>

<LI>Orc Wizard(level 90). These orcs have risen to power because they are
the only ones who can handle the shadowbeasts which hunt the Orc Warrens.
They have two spells, blinding flash and groundbolt. Needs walking, standing,
fighting and strike-ground-with-staff animations, corpse view.</LI>

<LI>Orc Overlord (level 175). This creature is tougher than a yeti. He
is a bit larger and quicker than a typical orc, and has a two-scimitar
attack. Can call orcs to his aid if he needs to. Needs walking, standing,
and fighting animations, corpse view and head item (ground, inventory and
look views).</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><B><I>Shadowbeast</I></B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Lives in caverns/mines. </LI>

<LI>Visual</LI>

<UL>
<LI>A grotesque version of the Kriipa (monsterX), created by some freakish
magical/genetic experiment by the Mad Wizard on Konima's Island. Has same
grossly large, freakishly grinning head, but tail is less important due
to the difficulty in jumping underground. Instead, has strong back legs,
and hugely developed front claws. Shambles around on all fours (perhaps
walks on back of hands to protect claws?), but moves very quickly.</LI>

<LI>Dark grey in color, glowing red eyes, transparent and difficult to
see. Side power is to make the room darker when they are in it, making
them even more difficult to see.</LI>

<LI>Needs standing, walking, fighting, corpse view.</LI>

<LI>No eyelids.</LI>

<LI>Quick.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Stats</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Level 125 (tougher than a Lupogg, but not supermonster class yet).
Does less damage per attack than his natural brother, but attacks frequently.
Tend to be loners.</LI>

<LI>Evil (karma -50).</LI>
</UL>

<LI>History/Mindset</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Preys on orcs, which alternatively prey on it, for food.</LI>

<LI>Clever without being intelligent. Orcs are terrified by their sneakiness.</LI>

<LI>Loners.</LI>

<LI>The result of a mad experiment on the island. It is unclear if the
architect of the Shadowbeast created the monster for fun, to eradicate
the orcs, or just as a first effort before trying more daring and noble
things with the Dragonflies.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><B><I>Lupogg&nbsp;King</I></B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Sewer based. In a room yet to be designed, which connects Jasper Sewers
with Barloque Sewers.</LI>

<LI>Visual</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Large sewer/swamp monster. </LI>

<LI>Twice as tall as a human.</LI>

<LI>Has key attributes shared with Lupogg</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Similiar skin color</LI>

<LI>Eyestalks</LI>

<LI>Mouth shape</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Possibly has four or six legs instead of two. These may be stunted,
since the Lupogg King has grown so fat that he cannot leave his central
chamber.</LI>

<LI>Possibly has tiny (T.Rex style) arms.</LI>

<LI>Either lots of little tongues, or slime coming out of mouth.</LI>

<LI>Animations: resting, wading, spitting, chomping, corpse view.</LI>

<LI>Should have 'supermonster' feel.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Stats</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Good in karma (20).</LI>

<LI>250th level (toughest monster to date).</LI>

<LI>Attack style is to paralyze whoever it is fighting. Key to defeating
is to make it switch targets after it paralyzes your bud. Paralyze attack
is a projectile, to prevent it from being fireballable.</LI>

<LI>Slow moving, but mobile. </LI>
