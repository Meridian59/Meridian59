This is the first taste of the jungle, and of the island (other than the city).  There are three paths leading out into the jungle, each marked with one or two tall totem like stones covered with intricate carvings.  The center path, leading to the northeast, is built of stones set in the ground.  The exit from the guard tower lies to the southwest, with cliffs overlooking the ocean to the west and south.  Standing at the edge of the cliffs, players can look back toward the city to see the tower built into the cliffs.  Players that are still within the tower can look out at the clearing in front of the tower and see the three paths.
