<P>
The original site for the Riija temple.  The stone path from the city ends here at the ruins, but continues beyond the rubble as a worn dirt path.  The humans, under supervision of the Riija Monk(s?), began to build the temple in this clearing.  The wandering Warrior Avars saw this as a place of power and their hostile encroachment caused construction to be halted before getting very far along.  As a reaction to this, the monk created the new temple on the small island to the northeast of the main island.  A magical bridge was created to allow passage and keep wandering Avars from invading.  The new temple on the island was created out of illusion because the monk couldn't build a large, ornate temple on his own.  The few remains of the first attempt at creating a temple that are left here are worn and weathered with age.  The two clans of Warrior Avars still battle over this site, and can often be found here engaged in their "holy war".
