<P>
Perhaps the greatest mystery of the island.  The tough as nails merchant (Quest NPC III) speaks both avar and the native konima language as well as the mainland Meridian language.  Once he's comfortable with someone, he may even speak fondly of Tos or Barloque.  He's very smart, but very slimy.  He has combined his brains with a relentlessly selfish desire for wealth and created a trading post to supply both the avar and the human citizens with items from both cultures.  Although technically he's probably a criminal in both societies for his heavy trade with the other, he manages to keep his store open, and his customers happy.  The trading post itself isn't just a store, but a gathering place, where humans and avars can mingle peacefully (and sometimes not so peacefully).  Though not all human customers get along with avars and not all avar customers get along with humans, they all tolerate each other while here, and will usually just ignore each other rather that cause trouble.
