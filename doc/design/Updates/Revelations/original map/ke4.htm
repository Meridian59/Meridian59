<P>
The Avar Village is set on a beach that is reached from a gentle slope out of the jungle.  To the north is a small bay and the cliffs can be seen wrapping around it.  To the east is the great ocean, and from the south, the cliff home of the mad scientist can be seen (or at least the cliffs he lives on).  A mysterious giant stone idol marks the center of the village.  Though its origin is unknown to humans and avars alike, the avars are in such awe of it, that they believe it is worthy of worship.  Perhaps they see it as a god, or as a gift from a god.  The village circles the idol, and the buildings keep a respectful distance.  The buildings are open air huts built up from random uneven stone that was gathered (not shaped), loosely stacked, and packed with mud.  The shaman of the village have marked off a place of their own, where they ring themselves around a large central fire so they can combine magical energies.
