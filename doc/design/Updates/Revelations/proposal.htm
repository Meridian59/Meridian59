<H2>Game Design Proposal</H2>

<P><A HREF="backstory.htm">[backstory]</A> <A HREF="artlist.htm">[tentative
artlist]</A></P>

<H3><B>Provide 'more'</B></H3>

<P><I>The players have spoken, and uniformly, they want more. More spells,
more skills, more items, more monsters, more new areas. Fortunately, with
additional personnel, these are things that we can add relatively easily.
If we worry less about adding new functionality and more about building
things with existing functionality, we can add a lot. This is particularly
true for areas, monsters and spells.</I></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Add Konima's Island area. </B></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Konima's Island is a jungle area, of about 8-10 rooms It has one multiple
person puzzle in it. It is inhabited by <I>avars</I>, a race of aboriginal,
flightless birds with simple tool-making ability. The monsters here are
extremely high level, and are not to be taken lightly.</LI>

</UL>
</UL>
</UL>

<LI><B>Add Riija Temple<BR>
</B><I>Riija's Temple is only solved after completing the quest, which
shows the path across the bridge of faith. Once across, you see a grandiose
temple, but if someone casts Jala's 'Truth' spell or Kraanan's 'Dispel
Illusion' spell, you will see the temple is in reality a simple mud hut.</I></LI>

<UL>
<LI>Client:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Bridge of faith.</LI>

<LI>NPCs: Riija monk.</LI>
</UL>

mining the green mineral Nerudite, which they use to forge superior weaponry.</LI>

<LI><B>Add Orc Warrens.</B></LI>

<UL>
<LI>The orc warrens are a very difficult area which newbies will have a
very hard time getting through at all, and the hardest of the hard-core
games will need a group merely to do the simple puzzles getting through,
much less survive.</LI>

<P><I>There are things that we have done that we can do better. One example
is the quest engine, which was never expected to make it into the game
