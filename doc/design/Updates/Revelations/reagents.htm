<H2>Reagents </H2>

<P><B>Rainbow Fern </B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: common </LI>

<LI>Art: fern drawn in greyscale (pitch-shiftable). </LI>

<LI>Where found: Herb shop, growing in jungle (5 locations, generate once
every half hour) </LI>

<LI>Description: This jungle plant was once as common as weeds throughout
the Koniman Jungle, until it's strength as a spell reagent was discovered.
Now, amateur herbologists plunder the jungle in search of it's benefits.</LI>

<LI>Real scoop: The fern changes color, depending on what time it is. This
fern is an ideal common reagent for Riija spells, due to it's natural color-shifting
power. </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Uncut Seraphym</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: common</LI>

<LI>Art: ugly, blue colored gem, perhaps with a vein that flashes occasionally.</LI>

<LI>Where found: orc miners and orc shamans carry them. Sold in herb shop,
for a steeper price.</LI>

<LI>Description: There must be something remarkable about this ugly lump
of stone, for the wizards of the orc clans certainly seem fond of them.
A vein in the rock pulses occasionally, like a heartbeat.</LI>

<LI>Real scoop: See <I>polished Seraphym</I> below. Note that this is the
rock that orc shamans use in their staves for magic.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Firesand</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: common</LI>

<LI>Art: pile of dark red sand.Scattered patch of dark red sand for dropped
view. Glittering animation would be a bonus.</LI>

<LI>Where found: patches can occasionally be found on the beaches of meridian.
Herb shop.</LI>

<LI>Description: This has the texture and grit of ordinary sand, but it
is warm to the touch and carries a dark red hue, almost as if some unfortunate
creature met it's demise upon the beach.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Eye of Dragonfly</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: uncommon</LI>

<LI>Art: a somewhat non-gross looking eyeball.</LI>

<LI>Where found: herb shop (for a steep price). Can occasionally be found
on the corpses of dead dragonflies.</LI>

<LI>Description: The eyes of some of the gossamer winged wyverns have been
reputed to offer mystical effects to whomever possesses them. However,
since few dragonflies seem content to offer these up to casual stranger,
this has been a difficult theory to prove.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Kriipa Claws</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: uncommon</LI>

<LI>Art: A long, evil looking talon that matches the Kriipa art.</LI>

<LI>Where found: On kriipa corpses. Quest prize. Bowmistress sells these
'behind the counter' since she hunts them for sport.</LI>

<LI>Description: A perfect and unmarred thumbclaw of a kriipa is something
of great value to the Riija mage. However, given how much your average
kriipa uses his claws for the rending of flesh and bone, finding a perfect
and unmarred thumbclaw can be quite a chore.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Solagh</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: uncommon</LI>

<LI>Art: a vial of a milky white fluid.</LI>

<LI>Where found: In stores. As a quest prize.</LI>

<LI>Description: No one knows what this milky white liquid is, or where
it comes from, save for a handful of the world's alchemists. It is rumored
that its ingredients are cheap and its distillation fairly simple, but
the secret to it's creation is closely guarded, mostly just to keep the
price shored up.</LI>

<LI>Real scoop: Every alchemist in the world should have some evasive answer
to the word 'solagh'.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Web Moss</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: rare</LI>

<LI>Art: white, mossy substance.</LI>

<LI>Where found: In stores. As a quest prize. Carried by orc shamans, avar
shamans.</LI>

<LI>Description: One of the world's more ingenious carniverous plants,
web moss captures small insects much as a spider web does, and then folds
over on itself to devour it's prey. Harvesting this substance is a dangerous
and tedious process, but once the moss has dried, it can be invaluable
for the casting of some spells.</LI>

<LI>Real scoop: in the future, maybe we can have man-eating size web moss
=)</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Blood of the Shaman</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: rare</LI>

<LI>Art: A pool of blood. A vial of blood</LI>

<LI>Where found: only by killing avar shamans with an unholy blade.</LI>

<LI>Description: Spellcasters of the birdlike avars do not learn their
abilities. Quite the opposite, the magic courses through their veins -
which means that it is magic that can be borrowed.</LI>

<LI>Real scoop: Used to cast the new high level Qor spells. The hint to
kill the shaman with an unholy blade should exist somewhere.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Polished Seraphym</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: very rare</LI>

<LI>Art: A beautiful gem with a beating vein in it - should be similiar
color to uncut version.</LI>

<LI>Where found: only as a quest prize.</LI>

<LI>Description: They say that a perfect seraphym gem can be used to capture
the souls of your beaten enemies, damning them to an eternal hell of torture
and agony. However, it should be noted that &quot;they&quot; are complete
idiots who know nothing about magic.</LI>

<LI>Real scoop: Every once in a while, a quest is created where one of
the NPCs tells a player that&nbsp;he wants to practice his jewelling ability,
and if you bring him a bit of unpolished Seraphym, he'll polish it into
a true gem. Unpolished seraphym is relatively easy to get hold of. Also:
one of the NPCs should have the following bit of dialogue if you say Seraphym:
&quot;A perfect seraphym gem can be used to capture the souls of your beaten
enemies, damning them to an eternal hell of torture and agony!&quot; </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Sap of the Yrx'l (or Yrxlsap)</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Rarity: very rare.</LI>

<LI>Art: A pool of a sticky, yellow substance. A vial of a sticky, yellow
substance. Also: need tree graphic of the Yrx'l.</LI>

<LI>Where found: at the foot of the Yrx'l, a tree found in the jungle on
the island. Once ever 30-90 minutes, the tree sees if there is any sap
in the room anywhere (even if someone is carrying it), and if not, it creates
some and places it at the base of the tree.</LI>

<LI>Description: There is but one known Yrx'l still known to civilization,
for mages have craved the blood of the eldritch tree, which provided the
lifeblood to their more powerful spells. Now that all are extinct on Meridian's
mainland and only one exists here, it is an unspoken rule that one shall
leave the tree alone, and allow it to provide its life blood as it chooses.</LI>

<LI>Real scoop: this is used to cast ultra-powerful spells such as morph.</LI>
