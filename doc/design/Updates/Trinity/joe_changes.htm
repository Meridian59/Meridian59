<h2>Changes to the Game</h2>

    <LI>02/10/99 - Completed implementation of scripts and kod changes for stat bug fix.  I Will post lists of characters who will need manual adjustment on \\nwchat\statfix\manual.  There seem to be ~100 characters in need of manual fix.  They look to be mostly people w/ the SOTH bug from insurrection who still haven't been fixed.  Grrr.
