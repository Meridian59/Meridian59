<HR WIDTH="100%">
<HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Duke Akardius: </FONT></P>

<P>Akardius (nephew of the murdered Duke Kalior) is young, 16 or so, but
wise beyond his years (almost eerily so). He is a zealous devotee of Riija,
though he probably wouldn't say so in so many words. He has the look of
religous fervour in his face, though, and his cunning smile betrays his
nature as the manipulative, deceitful aspect of the Trickster. His ascent
to power is an indicator of the return of Riija's influence to Meridian,
triggered by the rediscovery of the Island. His style of dress is opulent,
though not exactly foppish; he carries his regal attire with the distinguished
bearing of of a seasoned politician. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Princess Kateriina: </FONT></P>

<P>She's grown up quite a bit since her premature entry onto the political
scene, and having reached her 18th birthday (I smell an event...) is blossoming
into the strong woman she is to become. She is not wise to the ways of
political intrigue, such matters being obvious to her as tertiary to the
real business of running the realm strongly and justly. Indeed, she wears
her naivete on her sleeve as a badge of honor, her absolute sincerity being
her primary weapon against her political opponents. Her style of dress
is simple and elegant, block colors and strong lines (think medieval power
suit). 
<HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Miriana:</FONT></P>

<P>Same girl, but with a new menacing pose for the advanced stages of Volume
II and for Volume III. She stares at the viewer, eyes slightly down, hands
to her sides. Something is not right with this girl. Additional 3-frame
animation, same menacing pose but with her eyes glowing slightly red and
a flux of magic whorling around her hands, her dress and hair blowing in
the breeze (or in the flux of magical energy). The idea is that there be
a progression as the Volumes are released. First she starts visiting nodes
and shrines with her current art, then she switches to the second (static,
nonglowing) look halfway through Volume II. Whenever she attacks a node
or shrine or town, she switches to the glowing animated art. By Volume
III, she's pretty much always glowing and scary. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"><B>Hester Gilk:</B></P>

<P>A wandering refugee of the recently-destroyed town of Cor Noth, Hester
Gilk begins to reveal her fortune-telling abilities to the citizens of
Merdian. She is the one npc in Meridian who truly understands what Miriana
is becoming, because she too is not exactly human; Hester, Miriana, and
Venya'cyr are manifestations of the Three (witches) of mythology. Miriana
is the youngest, Venya'cyr is in the middle, and Hester is the eldest.
She manifests as an old gypsy crone, continually knitting (though since
Venya'cyr displays the death aspect the most prominently of the three,
Hester assumes the motherly role). Just as Miriana is an aspect of the
Furies (one aspect of the Three), Hester is an aspect of the Fates. As
she weaves her tapestry, she reads fortunes in its stitches, and she alone
knows what the tapestry might look like when it has finished, depending
on how the threads are woven now. She provides cryptic foreshadowing of
events to come in future volumes, and clues as to how to stop Miriana from
destroying Meridian. She is stooped with age, wears robes intricately patterned
(perhaps in Middle-Eastern fashion) but a bit grubby and worn in spots.
She carries a brightly colored cloth which she is weaving intricately,
and slung over one shoulder she carries a bag filled with brightly colored
thread. It may be revealed at some point the Hester Gilk is not her real
name at all. Names have power, after all. Those who discover her real name
may use that knowledge to learn more from her.
<HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Izzio:</FONT></P>

<P>A dark-skinned, middle-aged man who wanders from town to town selling
junk, and odds and ends that players sell to him. He has a portly, round
belly and is dressed colorfully, adorned with trinkets. His tight, short,
white curly hair frames a large expressive face which is smiles, all smiles.
He carries a large sack over one shoulder in which he holds his wares.
