<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Volume I: Insurrection</FONT></P>

<P>The duke is murdered. His nephew Akardius, though still quite young,
assumes his title. The youth is skilled in the ways of political intrigue,
and somehow manages to convince enough councillors that he holds as much
of a claim to the throne as did his uncle (though, players may recall,
the duke's original claim to the throne was based almost entirely on his
age and experience compared to the princess' youth, whereas neither of
those factors apply to Akardius). Alzahakar believes that Akardius' rise
is indicative of the return of Riija's influence on Meridian. Princess
Kateriina, meanwhile, has blossomed into a lovely young woman. Her honest,
forthright manner stands in stark contrast to Akardius's scheming ways,
yet her naivety hurts her in the political arena, weakening what should
be a clear-cut claim to the throne. Jonas, incensed at Akardius's undeserved
designs on the throne and at Kateriina's ineffectual responses, sets up
headquarters in Jasper and begins to sow the age-old seeds of rebellion.
Law and order begins to break down in the kingdom. Roving bands of brigands
are becoming a common sight around the countryside, and in response Kateriina
begins to send out troops to keep the land safe. Akardius leaps on this
chance to send his troops out as well, and the inevitable skirmishes arise.
Amidst this atmosphere of confusion, the citizens of Jasper rebel, sending
out raiding parties to attack the troops of both factions and even lay
siege to Tos and Barloque (bard-driven events).</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Volume II: Fate</FONT></P>

<P>The faction-driven chaos around Meridian steps up, and the council is
forced to negotiate with Jonas to acknowledge his ability to take the throne
by force. Jonas becomes a faction which players may support, and some degree
of law and order is reestablished in the countryside. A number of new shrines
mysteriously appear in the world. There is NPC speculation that their appearance
is a sign of some sort, as well as speculation as to the use of the shrines.
In reality, the shrines have the ability to sway the balance of magical
strength towards the schools to which each shrine is dedicated. The offerings
which are used (by players) to dedicate shrines become more available in
the world. Miriana begins visiting nodes, sometimes casually and sometimes
with the intent of capturing the node's energy, thereby severing player
links to that node if she is not stopped in time. The councillors, concerned
with the increasingly disturbing events occurring in Meridian, both political
and mystical, decide to hold a summit in Cor Noth to decide what needs
to be done.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Volume III: Fury</FONT></P>

<P>During the meeting of the councillors in Cor Noth Miriana calls down
a bolt from the heavens, levelling Cor Noth to pile of cratered rubble
and killing all the councillors and most of the citizens of Cor Noth. Hester
Gilk, one of the few survivors, begins wandering the countryside embroidering
a mysterious tapestry and fortelling a grim future for Merdian. A lost
book of Jala's teachings is discovered amongst the rubble of Cor Noth.
It details a long-forgotten method of mystical teaching which allows players
to magically transfer their knowledge of spells and skills to other players.
In response to the sudden lack of a council, the three faction leaders
appoint a council of the guildmasters of the five guilds who are strongest
in each of five disciplines (the areas of focus of the old councillors),
thereby giving those players a degree of control over the workings of the
sphere of knowledge they control. The princess opens up the old state room
of the bourgouis castle for meetings of the new council. Meanwhile, Miriana's
attacks on the nodes are becoming more and more frequent, and the length
of time necessary for her to tap a node becomes shorter and shorter. She
also begins to atack towns and seize control of shrines, dedicating them
to 'the void'. It becomes clear through the prophecies of Hester Gilk that
if something is not done to stop Miriana, her strange actions will bring
about disaster for Meridian.</P>
