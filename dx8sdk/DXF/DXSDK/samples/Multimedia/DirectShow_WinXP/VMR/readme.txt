Windows XP Video Mixing Renderer Samples
----------------------------------------

These samples demonstrate using the Windows XP Video Mixing Renderer
and provide examples of many of the VMR's new features and capabilities.
All of these examples are written with C++.


NOTE: These samples require Windows XP (or greater) and will exit 
on older systems.

NOTE: The DirectShow_WinXP samples do not yet build properly for UNICODE.
