   asshq_sign = sign.bgf

   asshq_rules1 = "Are you a true assassin, able to use guile, stealth and deception "
      "over brute force? Do you have the stomach to stick a dagger between the shoulder "
      "blades of a friend, a guild mate, or a lover? Be warned, this game is only for the "
      "elite, and if you are not paranoid now, you will be.\n\n"
      "+ Say 'advertise' to me if you wish to be told when I am calling a game."
      "\n+ Say 'no advertise' to cease getting these messages.\n+ Say 'blade' to "
      "get a blade.  Note that the game does not start until I tell you it starts.\n+ Say 'quit' "
      "if you decide you have not the nerve for this.\n"
      "\nI'd strongly advise you to read all five of the signs in these chambers.  You not knowing the "
      "rules of the Assassin's Circle is not, ultimately, my problem."
   asshq_rules2 = "+ If you join the proceedings, you will be given a dagger.  "
      "Eventually, a name will appear on this dagger.  Your goal is to attack and "
      "kill this person, but only with this dagger.\n\n+ Someone will also have your name on his "
      "dagger.  Once you learn who he is (most likely when he attacks you), slay him with your blade "
      "(and only with your blade).  Do not attack anyone else with your dagger.\n\n+A winner is declared when "
      "there is only one combatant left in the Assassin's Circle.\n\n+ The black blades do not do their damage to the "
      "body, but rather to your target's soul.  In the hilt of the dagger, there "
      "are four gems set.  For each hit that you take from a would-be assassin, one gem "
      "extinguishes itself, showing the damage done.  When all four go out, you die, and are expelled from the game. "
      "These gems heal back at a rate of one every five minutes.\n\n"
      "+ The paltry teachings of the weapon masters have no effects on your ability to wield the black dagger.  "
      "All are equal in this contest, and have equal proficiency with the daggers."
   asshq_rules3 = "+ I laugh at Shal'ille's protective magics.  While wielding a black dagger, "
      "you may attack your targets nearly anywhere.  Be warned, though, for it also means that you, "
      "as well, are vulnerable.\n\n+ True assassins are also above the law.  While wielding the "
      "dagger, you will find that you are not troubled by such nuisances as safeties or outlaw/murderer "
      "flags.  Be warned, though, that should you use any weapon other than the dark blade, even to "
      "defend yourself, you have to take normal consequences for your actions.  Spells also have the same "
      "consequences, whether you wield a blade or not. Keep your safety on "
      "if you wish to avoid accidents.\n\n"
      "+ Assassins should have honor.  Many wannabes do not, so the blades will divert their attacks from those "
      "that are incapacitated by spells.  Also, magical means of stealth will be stripped from you after you "
      "successfully strike your victim.\n\n"
      "+ Note that killing your target with means other than a black dagger will not expel him from the game."

   asshq_rules4 = "+ The same magic that makes a black dagger so deadly to whoever's name is "
      "inscribed upon it also makes it very fragile should it hit anyone else, whether they are in the "
      "game or not.  There is a chance that your blade could shatter, should you hit someone who is not "
      "your proper target, and if this happens, I will expel you from the game. There is one exception: "
      "you can (and should) use the black blade to defeat and kill whoever's blade bears your name.\n\n"
      "+ Worry not about death by blade.  I have a compact with Qor, and therefore the cost of death is "
      "lessened should you die by dark blade."
   asshq_rules5 = "+ We cannot have the game polluted by people who join in and then do not log on "
      "enough to risk being killed.  If you are not logging on enough to satisfy me, I will expel you "
      "from the game.  This, ultimately, is not my problem.\n\n"
      "+ I have no patience for cowards who depart this realm (i.e. 'log off') as soon as they find "
      "themselves under attack.  If you leave this realm while your soul is rent (and one of your dagger gems"
      " therefore extinguished), I will expel you from the game.  Again, this is not my problem.\n\n"
      "+ If three days pass without a kill, I will call off the game in disgust."
