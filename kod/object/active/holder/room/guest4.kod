      "Occasionally, you will find quests where a shopkeeper "
      "or other townsman desires you to bring him a certain item "
      "or peform some errand.  "
      "More frequently, after killing a monster you will find items "
      "that you yourself have no need for but that you can sell to get "
      "the weapons and other equipment that you do need.  For example, "
      "you may have found entroot berries after killing some mummies.  "
      "Use the OFFER command, or press the CONTROL key and O to offer "
      "these to Ravi, the apothecary.\n\n"
      "It should be noted that not every NPC wants every item.  Ravi, for "
      "example, has no interest in purchasing weapons so if you offer them to him, "
      "it will confuse him.  He may even think that it's a gift, and take it "
      "from your astonished hands.  If you SAY 'buy' or 'sell', you should get "
      "a good idea of what any shopkeeper is willing to take off your hands.\n"
