      "Being able to communicate is an important part of Meridian, "

      "allies. The most common way to communicate is with the SAY "
      "command. For example, if you type SAY HELLO, the elder in this "
      "hut will respond. The hotkey for SAY is F, which will automatically "
      "bring you down to the chat window.\n\n"             
      "Any other player who happens to be in the same map area as you "
      "can hear what you say.  However, most shopkeepers and elders "
      "are hard of hearing; you need to get close for them to hear you.\n\n"
      "There are other communications options.  For example, you may see other "
      "players broadcasting what's going on in the rest of the world. "
