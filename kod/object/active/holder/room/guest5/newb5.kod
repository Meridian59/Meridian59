      "Being able to communicate is an important part of Meridian, "
      "whether you're solving a quest or you're plotting with your "
      "allies. The most common way to communicate is with the SAY "
      "command. For example, if you type SAY HELLO, the elder in this "
      "hut will respond.\n\n"				 
      "Any other player who happens to be in the same map area as you "
      "can hear what you say.  However, most shopkeepers and elders "
      "are hard of hearing; you need to get close for them to hear you.\n\n"
      "Another communication option is BROADCAST.  If you type BROADCAST HELLO, "
      "you will then be saying hello to everyone online.  However, you should note "
      "that it is not considered good etiquette to fill the broadcast channel with "
      "useless messages, and for that reason, every broadcast you do carries a cost of "
      "half your mana.  Watch what other people broadcast to get a feel for what is "
      "appropriate.\n"
      "-------------------------\n"
      "Say QUEST to see what you should do next."
