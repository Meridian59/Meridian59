      "you lose it when you take damage (usually in battle).  If your health is "
      "reduced to zero, you die.  Mana determines how many spells "
      "you can cast.  Both of these come back with time.\n\n"
      "Vigor, the third stat, is the most important.  How fast your "
      "health and your mana return depends largely on your vigor. "
      "Also, running requires vigor "
      "so you definitely want to keep your vigor high. "
      "There are two ways to increase your vigor--by eating food ([USE] it from your inventory) "
      "and by resting (click on the button in the toolbar).  "
      "Resting in inns and taverns will heal your vigor "
      "twice as quickly.  Taverns and stores also frequently sell foodstuffs "
