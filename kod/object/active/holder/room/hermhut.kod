   hermhut_book_text = "   Recently, humans have begun to expand their travels back "
   	"into the Quilicia Woods, ignoring ancient superstitions of the faerie folk.  "
   	"According to the legends the woods were the domain of Shal'ille's favored "
	   "beings, the fey elhai.  When Shal'ille took form with the winds as the goddess "
   	"of peace, she was so enamored with the wholesome spirit of these faerie folk that "
	   "she made a home for them.  Channeling a node of power, she created the Vale of "
   	"Light, a place of unbridled goodness for the fey elhai to play and watch over.  "
	   "This enchanted valley existed in harmony with nature for many years to come.  "
   	"One day, one of the faeries became curious of the world beyond the glimmering "
	   "vale and ventured out past Quilicia.  On its travels it happened across the "
   	"path of a servant of Qor, who learning of the hidden magical node reported "
	   "back to his dark goddess.  Qor became obsessed with learning the location of "
   	"this link to power and demanded the capture of the little fey.\n"
	   "¶"
   	"   In a grim ceremony, the servants of Qor tore the spirit from the captured "
	   "fey elhai and ruthlessly discarded it.  They then focused the essence of Qor "
   	"into the carcass and revived it in the name of the unholy.  In this new form, "
	   "Qor scoured the countryside until she came upon a search party sent out by the "
   	"fey elhai.  Feigning sickness, she was escorted back to the Vale of Light.  "
	   "Once there, Qor realized the power of Shal'ille was too prevalent for her to "
   	"overcome.  Another more devious tactic was required.  Over the next few months, "
	   "Qor spawned dozens of corrupt faeries, which came to be known as the fey dirhai.  "
   	"Tainted with evil, they turned on their brethren and began an epic war for control "
	   "of the node.  Qor left satisfied that in time the seed of darkness would flourish "
   	"and gain her dominion over the Vale.\n"
	   "¶"
   	"   Having witnessed the corruption of her favorite people, Shal'ille mournfully "
	   "turned her eyes from the Vale.  Ashamed for their brothers and the blasphemous war "
   	"that waged on, the fey elhai have since called that for which they fight \"The Vale "
	   "of Sorrows.\""
