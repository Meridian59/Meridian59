	"By Coitla cha'Oztya, 224th year of the settlement.\n"
	"\n"
	"   Several centuries ago, our forefathers established the great settlement "
	"of Ko'catan.  It was not built on learning or trade, but on sweat and blood.\n"
	"\n" 
	"   In the Time Before, our hero and savior Konima lead less than one hundred "
	"warriors into the caves of the Utom.  Konima, a great military strategist and "
	"swordsman unparalleled bravely brought the war to the heart of the enemy.  "
	"There is no written record of the civilization from which they came.  The "
	"oral stories of our predecessors tell of a decedent land run amok with "
	"bizarre politics and meaningless wars, though some say the people were "
	"essentially good and deserving of the sacrifice made by our ancestors.  Most "
	"believe that this land no longer exists and the people are dead.  The truth, "
	"we may never know.\n"
	"\n"
	"   Having taken the horrible battle to the heart of the Utom, Konima knew "
	"that there would be no returning to his homeland.  The battle was not going "
	"well.  The utom had ambushed the warriors.  His numbers were low.  There was "
	"no food left.  And those left in his command were unaware of how badly injured "
	"Konima was.\n"
	"\n"
	"¶"
	"   It was at the last days of Konima's life that a scout party made their way "
	"through a series of caverns and emerged on the sandy shores of the Island.  "
	"Fresh air and food abound, it promised salvation for the war-ravaged group.  "
	"Sadly, the scouts were not quick enough; hours before returning with their "
	"good news, the great Konima passed on from deep internal wounds.  His last "
	"words were, \"You have all bravely followed me to what is to be our tomb.  "
	"You have all saved the lives of thousands at the cost of your own.  Should "
	"any of you survive these final hours by some folly of the old gods, know well "
	"that I will see you again.  For one day you and all of your descendants will "
	"stand beside me in the glorious ever-after.\"\n"    
	"\n"
	"   The warrior men and women carried his body to the oceanfront and erected "
	"a memorial tomb that one day would become the Hall of Heroes.  This was to be "
	"the beginning of the Settlement.  At first, they prepared for the utom to "
	"follow them to the surface to slaughter them all.  But the utom never came.  "
	"In fact, to this day the utom shun the open air of the island at all costs.  "
	"No one knows what they fear on the island.\n"
	"¶"  
	"   It was not long before our predecessors encountered the first Avar tribe.  "
	"After a series of bloody battles, the great barrier wall was built. For six "
	"generations of Warlords, we have stood strong against the various tribes on "
	"the island.  Although at one point our established territory went all the way "
	"to the old temple ruins, we have never lost Ko'catan to invaders.  Not even "
	"during the slaughter of the fifth warlord, when Avars attacked from the "
	"undefended beachfront.\n"
	"\n"  
	"   Ko'catan is strong and with the spirit of Konima at its heart, we shall never fall."
