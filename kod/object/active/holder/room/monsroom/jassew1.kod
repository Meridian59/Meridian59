      "    In the early part of the 5th century, an oppressive tax was laid upon "
      "the land to make reparations after the wars between Barloque and Tos and to "
      "line the pockets of the Empire Investors.  Troupes of men would patrol the "
      "countryside, ensuring that all merchandise was properly accounted for and "
      "taxed.  This lead the age of smugglers.\n"
      "    In the name of clean sanitation, the city workers of Barloque and Jasper "
      "began working on an intricate sewer system.  Secretly funded by illicit "
      "factions, they connected the subterranean tunnel system all the way from one "
      "city to the other.  The smell alone kept the local constabulary from "
      "investigating the extended work schedule.  Once complete, gems were taken "
      "from the mines of Jasper to the ports of Barloque and stashed away for their "
      "journey to the black markets of the Old Empire.  In return, certain goods "
      "would avoid the taxation of the land by travelling back through the sewer "
      "systems to the miners' town.  To avoid being double-crossed by the criminal "
      "faction of the other city, a system was built to make equitable trades.\n"
      "    The Smuggler's Crossing existed somewhere deep underground between the "
      "two cities.  Gates were established in such a way that neither side could "
      "cross without aid from the other.  Goods would be exchanged for gems here.\n"
      "    Later, during the first Jasper rebellion, loyalists used the intricate "
      "sewer system to smuggle armaments.  The government never was to become aware "
      "of this method.\n"
      "¶"
      "    None know what exactly ended this practice.  Some say a heated argument "
      "got out of control as wizards from the two factions violently battled at the "
      "Crossing.  Others say that when the great Nexus buckled in 450 Meridian Era, "
      "a tremendous earthquake ripped through the tunnels.  Whatever the cause, a "
      "huge crack opened up at the crossing.  A bridge was to be built, but the "
      "gaping chasm harbored more than met the eye.\n"
      "    Strange croaking and groaning filled the cave.  Stories surfaced about "
      "dead men being found in the sewer cut in half by mighty jaws of some unknown "
      "creature.  As fear in the land rose, a threat of a Royal Investigation became "
      "imminent.  Both factions decided it would be best to quit activities before "
      "the public focus lead to them.  Some time around the middle of the 5th century, "
      "the crossing was sealed up and forgotten from history.\n"
      "   Recently, brave adventures have stumble upon the old Smuggler's Crossing.  "
      "Stopped at the rusted gates, they claim to hear monstrous sounds echoing through "
      "the caverns.  All who return say the same thing, \"There is Something down "
      "there, something big!  Avoid the area at all costs or bring many, many "
      "companions if you are foolish enough to investigate. \""
