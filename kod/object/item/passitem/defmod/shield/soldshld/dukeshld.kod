      "our purpose to follow these rules for now.\n\n"
      "SOLDIER SHIELD: Your shield shows you as part of my army.  If you lose this "
      "shield, it signifies that you are no longer part of our army.\n\n"
      "ENEMY SOLDIERS: Enemies from the other pathetic faction have full right to try "
      "to attack you when they find you.  For this, they will suffer no penalty.  Of "
      "course, you will also be unpenalized for destroying them in combat.  I am sure "
      "our cowardly foes will take shelter in safe spots like inns or halls, but it is "
      "your job to be waiting for them to leave.  As with the regular members of my "
      "faction, I will not allow traitorous attacks against those loyal to me; to do so "
      "is to reduce your own power as you are removed from my service in all aspects.  "
      "In order to better defeat our enemies, I will teach you how to do additional "
      "damage to our enemies.  Deaths inflicted upon enemies will give them the penalties "
      "they deserve for standing up to us!\n\n"
      "RANKS: Kill our enemies, and I will see you raised to be worshiped by those that "
      "follow me.  Die or act dishonorably, and you will once again be at the lowest "
      "end of the army.  Those that try to leave this land unsafely and leave behind a "
      "ghost to escape combat will also meet with my displeasure.\n\n"
      "ABILITIES: In return for your loyal service, I will give you power!  I will teach "
      "you how to increase your natural stamina and agility in combat.  I will also show "
      "you ways to tap into the darker aspects of magic to boost all your spells.  These "
      "powers grow as you gain my attention and ranks within the army.\n\n"
      "THE COUNCILORS: The councilors whom we must convince do not wish you soldiers to "
      "interfere with the tokens.  For now, do as they say, for we must gain their trust "
      "if they are to declare me the true ruler I am.  Let one of my followers that is "
      "not a soldier take the token and convince the councilor of our might and our "
      "right.  Your job for now is to claim territory in my name.  Only soldiers can "
      "claim territory for our faction.\n\n"
      "LOYALTY: Do not bother yourself with tax errands while you are a soldier.  Murder "
      "our enemies in combat and you will demonstrate all the loyalty I need.\n\n"
      "We will take the throne of this kingdom.  You have given your support wisely.\n\n"
