      "Greetings.  I welcome you as a new ally in our fight to keep the throne from the "
      "forces that would see us come to harm.\n\n"
      "There are a few rules you must observe while acting as a soldier.\n\n"
      "SOLDIER SHIELD: Your shield is the sign that you are an official part of the "
      "Royal army.  You must keep this equipped at all times in order to demonstrate "
      "your position.\n\n"
      "ENEMY SOLDIERS: As agreed, you can be attacked by any enemy soldier in any place "
      "that is not a haven (such as an inn or hall).  Your attacker will not be "
      "recognized as a criminal for attacking or killing you.  Likewise, you can attack "
      "enemies without fear of penalty.  Note that attacking any fellow soldiers will vex "
      "me greatly, and I will remove you as a soldier and a member of my faction.  Also, "
      "our righteousness allows you to do additional damage with all your attacks to "
      "these enemy soldiers.  Please realize that deaths at the hands of enemy soldiers "
      "are real, and you will suffer the usual penalties.\n\n"
      "RANKS: Your position within the army is determined by your actions.  Killing enemy "
      "soldiers will allow you promotion within the ranks of the army.  Being killed or "
      "remaining inactive for long periods of time will show you a decrease in rank.  "
      "Do not try to escape combat by leaving this world in unsafe areas as this will "
      "also lower your rank.\n\n"
      "ABILITIES: With your status as a faction soldier, I will show you additional ways "
      "to increase your power.  I will make you more intelligent and able to comprehend "
      "all things mystical.  I will also teach you ways to reduce the cost of your "
      "spells.  The potence of these abilities will increase as you gain ranks.\n\n"
      "THE COUNCILORS: The councilors have declared that the tokens are too delicate to "
      "be entrusted to the hands of soldiers.  Therefore, you are instructed not to pick "
      "up any tokens you may find.  I encourage you to find an ally to take the token to "
      "the proper councilor should you find one.  Likewise, the councilos have declared "
      "that only faction soldiers may claim territory now.  The flags in my chambers may "
      "now only be carried by recognized soldiers of my faction.\n\n"
      "LOYALTY: While in the service of the royal army, I will not ask you to prove your "
      "loyalty as before.  You should concentrate on maintaining your rank.\n\n"
      "May Shal'ille guide your actions to ensure our victory!\n\n"
