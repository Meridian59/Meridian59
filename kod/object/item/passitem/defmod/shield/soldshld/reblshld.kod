      "the future of these lands against the forces of tyranny.\n\n"
      "I expect a certain level of discipline from my militia soldiers.  Read these "
      "rules and follow them without question.\n\n"
      "SOLDIER SHIELD: Your shield is the sign that you are an 'official' part of the "
      "rebel milita.  You must keep this equipped at all times in order to demonstrate "
      "your status within the rebel army.\n\n"
      "ENEMY SOLDIERS: Be wary!  You can be attacked without penalty by those bearing "
      "the colors of our faction enemies.  Only the safety of an inn or hall will protect "
      "you from attacks.  Attacks against enemies carry no penalties, just as these "
      "enemies will not be penalized for attacking you.  Attacking a soldier allied "
      "to our faction is cause enough to be expelled dishonorably from our army.  I will "
      "teach you various ways to inflict additional damage on these enemies in order to "
      "defend yourself and to help us reclaim our place in governing this land.  You "
      "should know that any deaths at the hands of an enemy will not be lessened.\n\n"
      "RANKS: Your position within our forces is determined by your actions.  Defeating "
      "enemy soldiers in combat will increase your rank.  Being killed or remaining idle "
      "in our fight will decrease in rank.  Also, fleeing from combat by leaving this "
      "world in unsafe areas will meet with my displeasure.  Simple enough?\n\n"
      "ABILITIES: You will receive additional training as a soldier.  I will increase "
      "your natural might and aim through rigorous exercise.  I will also teach you to "
      "avoid damage from enemy blows.  I will, of course, spend more time with higher "
      "ranking soldiers boosting their powers than with lower ranking ones.\n\n"
      "THE COUNCILORS: Your shield will interfere with your ability to recover tokens.  "
      "I want you to find a fellow rebel to take the token to the proper councilor should "
      "you find one.  Also know that only proper soldiers bearing shields can claim "
      "territory.  The flags in Pietro's may now only be carried and used by soldiers.\n\n"
      "LOYALTY: A soldier like yourself is expected to find your own equipment.  However, "
      "I do not expect you to continue to supply the guards protecting our flagpoles "
      "while you maintain your status as a soldier.\n\n"
      "Your brother in arms,\n\n"
