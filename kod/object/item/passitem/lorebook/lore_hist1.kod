      "     The waiting was the hardest part.  They had been waiting for "
      "hours.  Conversation had long since ceased, giving way to a palpable "
      "silence heavy with tension and worry.  The only sound in the drafty "
      "hall was the flicker of the torches on the pillars, and the patter of "
      "the rain outside.\n"
      "     Far'Nohl sat upon his throne at the far end of the hall, resting "
      "uneasily with his chin in his hand.  His fingers beat out a steady "
      "rhythm on the arm of the great stone chair.  He stared straight ahead, "
      "blinking seldom, focusing his gaze on nothing in particular.  His "
      "thoughts wandered aimlessly, and ever he tried to force them to focus "
      "on other matters, but they would always wander back to the concern at "
      "hand."
      "\n"
      "Sweat beaded beneath his tangled mass of red hair as endless worry "
      "gnawed at his psyche.\n"
      "     Something must have gone wrong, he thought.  We should have heard "
      "by now.\n"
      "     He was not alone in the hall, but the others with him were just as "
      "concerned, though they did not all show it.  Four members of his "
      "Council sat with him, keeping the vigil until the rest of their number "
      "arrived.  Each remained silent, but Far'Nohl wondered at how calm they "
      "appeared, despite the odds they currently faced.\n"
      "     Something mysterious had occurred.  The Great Empire was connected "
      "to all of its colonies through the mystical Nexus.  Two months ago, "
      "this colony's connection was severed.  No one knew how, but it "
      "happened.  The whole province knew the moment it did."
      "\n"
      "The land itself shook, and the sky seemed to rend apart, its brilliant "
      "blue giving way to deep scarlet.  The people had cried out in terror. "
      "Every mage collapsed to the ground, writhing as though in agony, "
      "screaming inhuman screams that could be heard across the land.\n"
      "     As quickly as the cataclysm struck, it had passed.  Within minutes "
      "the worst was over.  Or so they thought.  Soon, messengers were coming "
      "from the eastern border of the province.  They brought with them tales "
      "of monsters moving across the land.  The Empire had placed magical "
      "barriers around all its provinces to keep out their enemies.  With the "
      "connection to the Nexus severed, the Council feared the protections "
      "were no longer in place."
      "\n"
      "Hordes of enemies, the like of which had not been seen in the Empire "
      "since time out of mind, were now roaming the countryside killing at "
      "will.\n"
      "     As Prince Regent of the fifty-ninth Meridian of the Empire of the "
      "Nexus, Far'Nohl found himself the unwilling leader of a country at "
      "war.  Armed and ready though the people were, they knew precious little "
      "about the enemy which was even now marching toward them from beyond the "
      "Empire.  General Kraanan had been dispatched to scout their coming, and "
      "report what he could.  It was his return they were waiting for.\n"
      "     Kraanan's wife, Shal'ille, sat crossed-legged on the floor at the "
      "foot of a pillar, meditating quietly.  Her golden hair fell in careless "
      "waves around her upturned face, her eyes closed and her breathing deep."
      "\n"
      "She wore robes of purest white, with a belt of interlinked silver "
      "stars.  She folded her hands in her lap, holding a golden talisman in "
      "the shape of the sun.  Despite her outwardly calm demeanor, her own "
      "apprehension was made apparent by the worn spot on the talisman where "
      "her thumb had rubbed away the finish from the metal.\n"
      "     Her younger sister, Jala, was pacing back and forth along the "
      "length of the hall.  Her dark, brown hair was tied back in a tight "
      "braid.  Her robes were violet, deep and royal.  In her arms she carried "
      "a golden harp, which she occasionally strummed as though about to begin "
      "a song.  Each time she did, however, she seemed to think better of it "
      "and resumed her vigil.\n"
      "     Dark-haired and stolid Faren stood nearby, casually watching the "
      "flames dance on the end of a torch."
      "\n"
      "He stood against a pillar with his arms crossed over his heavy, brown "
      "robes.  As he watched the flames flicker in the darkness of the hall, "
      "he ran a hand thoughtfully through his thin beard.  He took comfort in "
      "the fire, and allowed it to mesmerize him, temporarily forgetting his "
      "stress.  Every now and again he would watch Jala, wishing he could "
      "reach out and comfort her.  He did not, though, and as he watched the "
      "torch he wondered why.\n"
      "     A wooden table sat to one side of the hall, and strewn across it "
      "were a large number of books and scrolls.  Seated before the pile was "
      "Riija, Far'Nohl's royal chronicler.  He seemed to take no notice of "
      "the others, but busied himself reading and re-reading ancient texts to "
      "keep his mind occupied."
      "\n"
      "He was a funny little man; shorter than the others and slightly wider, "
      "his hair had begun to receded leaving the very top of his head bare.  "
      "What hair he had left was bright red, and hung down almost to his "
      "shoulders.  He wore robes of a deep, deep, deep gold.  So dark it was "
      "almost brown.  On the table next to him sat a half-drunk bottle of "
      "wine.  He took it up, took a sip, and then went back to his work.\n"
      "     The reverie was broken by the echoing crash of the hall doors being"
      " thrown open. The sound was deafening in the silence, and made "
      "everyone's heart skip a beat.  Riija dropped the book he had been "
      "reading, and Jala nearly broke a harp string.  Far'Nohl snapped his "
      "head up, straightening as a rain-soaked, armor-clad figure strode the "
      "length of the hall, his cloak trailing behind him."
      "\n"
      "     General Kraanan was a tall and imposing man.  His hair was silver "
      "throughout, and cut short as befitted a soldier.  His beard was silver, "
      "as well, and long enough to reach the base of his neck.  His stark, "
      "blue eyes twinkled with a youthful vigor, however.  His armor, though "
      "unadorned, was dark red.  He had removed his helm, with its plume of "
      "black feathers, and carried it under his arm as he strode to the end of "
      "the hall and dropped to a knee before the prince.\n"
      "     \"My lord,\" he said.\n"
      "     \"Rise, General,\" said Far'Nohl, eagerly.  He looked to Shal'ille,"
      " who had leapt to her feet, and nodded to her.  She ran forward then, "
      "throwing her arms around her husband.  He embraced her in turn, rising "
      "from his knees and pulling her close.\n"
      "     \"Report, sir,\" Far'Nohl said after a time.  \"What news?\""
      "\n"
      "     \"My lord,\" Kraanan said again, releasing Shal'ille, \"what news "
      "I bring is grave, indeed.  All our worst fears have proven true.  The "
      "Nexus has severed, and the Empire's defenses have fallen.\"\n"
      "     \"How can that be?\" asked Jala.  \"It is not possible.\"\n"
      "     \"I assure you it is,\" Kraanan told her.  \"You felt it the same "
      "as I.  We all did.  Our connection to the Empire has been broken, and "
      "the shields which protected this land have vanished.  We are exposed, "
      "my lord.  The holes in the barrier have allowed all manner of unseemly "
      "creatures to enter our realm once more.  Orcs, first and foremost.  And "
      "our people have paid dearly for it.\n"
      "     \"The enemy has captured much of the East.  Even now, their forces "
      "march southwest from Silver Lamp.  At least, what used to be Silver "
      "Lamp."
      "\n"
      "The city has been completely destroyed.\"  He held up a roll of "
      "parchment then, and addressed Riija.  \"May I?\"\n"
      "     Riija shrugged and stood aside.  Kraanan moved to the table, the "
      "others following.  He pushed several of Riija's papers aside, and "
      "spread out his own scroll.  On it had been drawn a map of the land of "
      "the Meridian.\n"
      "     It was encircled on three sides by mountain range, and the Great "
      "Ocean to the north.  A second mountain range ran from south to north "
      "through the exact middle of the map.  Two large forests were drawn in "
      "green ink, and eight black dots indicated the location of cities.  "
      "Kraanan let his finger drop at a point on the northern side of the "
      "eastern forest, not far from a dot labeled as Jixa."
      "\n"
      "     \"This is where the enemy was last spotted,\" he explained.  \"My "
      "scouts report that both Berg and Silver Lamp have been utterly "
      "decimated.  The orcs are now marching westward toward the settlement of "
      "Jixa.\"  Berg and Silver Lamp had been crossed off the map in red ink."

      "     \"How many are they?\" Far'Nohl asked, considering the map.\n"
      "     \"Some thousands,\" said Kraanan.  \"We have not been able to "
      "assess their exact number.  There are trolls amongst them, as well, "
      "though.  They drive giant spiders before them like beasts of war.  Some "
      "have even been trained as wizards.\"\n"
      "     \"Orcs using magic?\" Shal'ille scoffed.  \"I don't believe it.\"\n"
      "     \"You should,\" Kraanan told her.  \"They use it, and they use it "
      "well.  Several of my scouts did not return.  Their fellows tell me some "
      "were felled from afar by fire or by ice or by lightning.\"\n"
      "     \"It is no wonder then that Berg and Silver Lamp were so thoroughly"
      " destroyed,\" said Far'Nohl.  \"Is it true that there is nothing left "
      "of them?\"\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"True enough,\" said Kraanan.  \"There is little remaining of "
      "Silver Lamp but a few scorched and burned foundations.  Every building "
      "has been burned to the ground, the walls and gates torn down, and its "
      "people dead almost to the last man.\n"
      "     \"Berg suffered a similar fate, though there is far less remaining "
      "of it.  Thatched roofs burn more easily than slate ones, as do wooden "
      "walls versus stone.  All that is left of Berg is a circle of blackened "
      "ash.  Or so the survivors tell us.\"\n"
      "     \"How many of the orcs are wizards?\" Shal'ille asked.\n "
      "     \"Not enough to have caused the damage described of Silver Lamp and"
      " Berg,\" said Kraanan.  The others nodded in agreement.  Each of them "
      "knew their magic well, and was versed in all manner of spells and "
      "incantations.  Yet nothing they had seen in all their studies and "
      "practices could cause that level of devastation so easily.\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"There were mages in those cities,\" Jala pointed out.  \"How "
      "could they not have mounted a defense?  If the orc wizards are so few, "
      "how could our spell casters not prove a match for them?\"\n"
      "     \"Do you suppose,\" asked Far'Nohl, \"that there is yet a greater "
      "power at their disposal, of which we do not yet know anything?\"\n"
      "     \"I suppose nothing,\" said Kraanan.  \"I know it for a fact.  The "
      "survivors speak of a great terror.  What exactly it is they cannot say, "
      "but it came upon them all of a sudden.  With it came a hot wind, and a "
      "stink of decay the likes of which they had not smelled before.  They "
      "describe it as huge, and that it flew down from the sky to lay low "
      "their houses as they ran, taken as they were unawares.  No weapon could "
      "pierce its hide, and precious little magic worked against it.  It came "
      "at the beckoning of the orcs, did as they commanded, and departed again "
      "at their word."
      "\n"
      "     \"Berg was attacked first, and the survivors ran north to Silver "
      "Lamp, but the orcs followed them.  They attacked travelers and merchant "
      "caravans along the way.  Silver Lamp managed a good fight.  They held "
      "out for several hours before they fell.  In the end, however, they were "
      "still defeated.\"\n"
      "     \"Were the reports the same?\" asked Jala.  \"Did those survivors "
      "also speak of a great terror?\"\n"
      "     \"They did,\" Kraanan answered.  \"Silver Lamp was larger, though, "
      "and so it took longer for the creature to destroy it.  They described "
      "it as a great beast, belching flame in all directions.  They could say "
      "precious little else about it, though.\"\n"
      "     \"How is that possible?\" asked Far'Nohl.  \"Did nobody get a "
      "decent look?\"\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"The orcs always led their assaults by night.  Under cover of "
      "darkness, despite the light of the stars or from the watch fires, the "
      "thing moved like a shadow above the city killing in its wake.\"\n"
      "     \"Riija,\" said Far'Nohl, turning to face his chronicler, \"what "
      "do you know of such a beast?  Is there any mention of a creature of "
      "this type in your lore and history?\"\n"
      "     \"Perhaps,\" Riija admitted.  \"I could not say for sure, but I "
      "will look, my lord.  If there is anything to be read, I shall find "
      "it.\"\n"
      "     \"Good,\" said Far'Nohl.  \"What other measures have been taken, "
      "General, to combat the orcs?\"\n"
      "     \"I have left a garrison at Jixa,\" said Kraanan.  \"More than "
      "half our strength sits there encamped, waiting for the orcs to arrive.  "
      "Qor currently has the command.\"\n"
      "     \"She will do well,\" Far'Nohl said.  \"She is cunning and "
      "powerful.\"\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"And ambitious,\" said Shal'ille, making no attempt to hide her "
      "disgust.  It was no secret that the two of them did not get along.  "
      "\"And devious.  I would not trust her with such a responsibility.  You "
      "give her too much power, Kraanan.  She will make you regret that.\"\n"
      "     \"Perhaps she will,\" said Far'Nohl, before Kraanan could answer. "
      "\"However, she is best suited to the task at the moment.  We have "
      "precious few options, and so no choice but to put our faith in her.\n"
      "     \"Be that as it may, I will take no unnecessary risks.  What "
      "should happen, Kraanan, if your garrison falls?\"\n"
      "     \"It will not,\" said Kraanan, sticking out his chest confidently. "
      "\"Although, in the event that it should, the orcs will continue their "
      "march west. The Cragged Mountains stand in their way, and there is but "
      "one small pass leading through them, just south of the Badlands.  They "
      "will have no choice but to attempt to move through it.\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"We will then have the advantage.  The western exit of the pass "
      "is narrow.  So narrow they will be forced to move through in single "
      "file. Any force of a decent size left to meet them would have no "
      "trouble holding that pass.  It is easy to defend; next to impossible "
      "to invade.\"\n"
      "     \"Then that is what we shall do,\" said Far'Nohl.  He turned to "
      "Faren, then.  \"I will send you ahead, Faren.  Make all haste to "
      "Barloque.  Tell Ambassador Darien to bring the Imperial garrison, and "
      "station them at the border of the Badlands with ours.\"\n"
      "     \"Do you think we will need that many soldiers, my lord?\" Faren "
      "asked, speaking for the first time.  He was a man of few words, and "
      "always chose them carefully.\n"
      "     \"As I said,\" Far'Nohl told him, \"I am not taking any more risks."
      "  I want as much of our strength as possible on hand should Jixa fall.  "
      "Send word to each of our cities that still stands for every willing and "
      "able fighter to join us, as well. Every sword counts.  Now go.\""
      "\n"
      "     \"As you wish, my lord,\" said Faren, inclining his head.  He cast "
      "one last longing look at Jala before he left, then turned on his heel "
      "and left the hall. Jala watched him leave, and kept her eyes on the "
      "door long after he had gone.  Only Shal'ille noticed the wistful look "
      "in her sister's eyes as she reluctantly turned back to the map, but she "
      "said nothing.\n"
      "     \"How long will you need to ready our troops?\" Far'Nohl asked of "
      "Kraanan.\n"
      "     \"They are ready now,\" he promised.\n"
      "     \"Good,\" said Far'Nohl.  \"Then fetch me my sword and my armor. "
      "Today; we march to war.\""
      "\n"
      "     The road to the border of the Badlands from Castle Victoria was "
      "not a long march.  Kraanan had gathered his forces before the gates, "
      "and they followed Far'Nohl as he led them through the valley of Ukgoth, "
      "and beneath the great mountain known as the Sentinel.\n"
      "     They had no choice but to take the long way around.  The way would "
      "have been shorter going directly north.  However, the walls of the "
      "valley were shear and impossible to climb.  Once you had entered the "
      "valley, there was only one way back out again, and that was under the "
      "shadow of the Sentinel.  Beyond that lay the ruins the people called "
      "the Ancient Place, its origin forgotten.  Then a winding pass through "
      "the southwestern spur of the Cragged Mountains led directly to the "
      "paved road known as the King's Way.  From there the going was easy."
      "\n"
      "     The road led to the university town of Cor Noth.  Beyond its "
      "northern gates the road forked east and west, and east led almost "
      "directly to the border of the Badlands.  The road passed through a "
      "small open flatland, and it was there they were joined by the Imperial "
      "garrison, with Faren by their side.\n"
      "     This land was one of the Empire's richest and most prosperous "
      "colonies.  As such, the Empire had taken a special interest in its "
      "defense."

      "     When word reached back to the Imperial Capitol that the land was "
      "besieged, ships appeared in the ports of Barloque, the colony's capital "
      "city, carrying five hundred spearmen and three hundred archers armed "
      "for war.  Before them rode Ambassador Darien, resplendent in his "
      "shining silver armor astride a mighty white war horse.\n"
      "     He alone rode to battle.  His army, as well as that of Far'Nohl, "
      "took no mounts.  All the same, Far'Nohl made an imposing sight himself, "
      "wearing his patterned bronze armor beneath a brilliant blue tabard "
      "lined in gold trim.  Atop his head he wore a bronze helm with a "
      "trailing blue plume of peacock feathers.  At his side he wore a "
      "two-handed long sword, with rubies encrusting its hilt.  The two "
      "commanders greeted each other silently at the crossroads, then "
      "continued on to the appointed spot."
      "\n\n\n"
      "     The Border of the Badlands was a small gully nestled in the "
      "foothills of the Cragged Mountains, to the north of the merchant city of "
      "Tos.  A narrow dirt road ran the length of it.  Next to that lay an "
      "open field roughly twenty yards across, and fifty yards north to "
      "south.  It was ringed by the arms of the mountains, and the narrow pass "
      "was tucked just behind a small outcrop of rock on the far side.  It was "
      "completely invisible from the road, but it was there all the same.\n"
      "     The two armies stopped in the field, and spread out up and down "
      "the road and beyond.  Together they numbered fifteen hundred.  As "
      "Kraanan had reported the orcs numbered in the thousands, Far'Nohl hoped "
      "against hope their numbers would be enough to stem the tide.  If the "
      "narrow pass proved the advantage they all hoped it would be, their "
      "numbers ought to be more than enough."

      "He was also putting a great deal of stock in the powers of his "

      "throw at them.\n"
      "     \"This seems a bit much to me,\" said Darien, swinging down off "
      "his horse.  A squire ran to take the reigns, as he strode forward to "
      "speak to Far'Nohl.  He removed his helm, revealing his bald head and "
      "well-groomed beard.  The sun shone off his highly polished armor, "
      "making him look every bit the embodiment of the Empire he was meant to "
      "be.  \"This is more than enough to defend this pass, Far'Nohl.  Was it "
      "truly necessary to call out the entirety of our strength?  A much "
      "smaller force could handle this, I am certain.\""

      "than they already have.\"\n"
      "     \"As you will,\" said the Ambassador.  He sniffed the air "
      "doubtfully, but did not argue further.  He exuded confidence to the "
      "point of arrogance. Far'Nohl shared a knowing look with Kraanan, who "
      "scoffed at the man and turned his attention back to the mountain pass.\n"
      "     \"I would send a messenger ahead,\" he said, \"to let the garrison "
      "at Jixa know we have come.\"\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"Do so,\" said Far'Nohl, \"and see that they return with word "
      "from Qor.  I want to know everything that happens on the other side of "
      "these mountains.  I will not be caught off guard if it can be "
      "helped.\"\n"
      "     Kraanan called for a squire, and gave her instructions.  She was "
      "off immediately, and disappeared behind the outcrop.\n"
      "     \"We will not have word back for at least an hour,\" said "
      "Kraanan.\n"
      "     \"We had best make ourselves comfortable then,\" said Darien.  He "
      "shouted the order to make camp, and his troops fell to their ease.\n"
      "     \"Tell ours to make camp, as well,\" said Far'Nohl, \"but do not "
      "allow them the same complacency I sense from the Ambassador.  I want "
      "every bow notched with an arrow, and a hand on every sword ready to "
      "draw.\"\n"
      "     \"What do you fear, my lord?\" asked Shal'ille.  \"Do you not feel "
      "we are prepared?\""
      "\n"
      "\"We are,\" said Far'Nohl, \"and I want to keep it that way.  I am not "
      "certain, but I have an ill feeling about this business.\"\n"
      "     \"We shall have victory,\" Darien assured him.  \"My troops shall "
      "see to it.\"\n"
      "     \"Do not get cocky,\" Far'Nohl warned him.  \"Against whatever "
      "power these orcs wield in secret, we cannot know our strength.  Your "
      "men may fight with great courage and ferocity, but I have no doubt the "
      "soldiers in Silver Lamp did as well.\"\n"
      "     \"I have been warned of this monster you speak of,\" said Darien. "
      "\"Young Faren here told me all about it.  A truly remarkable thing "
      "indeed, but nothing we cannot handle.  Such beasts are common "
      "throughout the Empire.  We have dealt with many such a challenge, and "
      "always we have been victorious.  Just leave it to me, Far'Nohl.\""
      "\n"
      "\"We shall win the day for you, I promise.\"  With that, he strode off "
      "to take a seat amongst his troops.\n"
      "     \"The fool,\" said Kraanan.  \"If I see him dead before this war "
      "is done, I will not be surprised in the least.\"\n"
      "     \"I hope not for our sake,\" said Far'Nohl.  \"We may need every "
      "warrior we can get.\"\n"
      "     \"More will come, my lord,\" said Faren.  \"I have already "
      "received assurances from "
      "Barloque and Tos.  Jasper will certainly send aid, and I would count "
      "on the resourcefulness of Marion, as well.\"\n"
      "     \"I will count on nothing until it is laid before my feet,\" said "
      "Far'Nohl.\n"
      "     \"My lord, please,\" said Jala.  \"I would not allow full "
      "complacency, but perhaps "
      "it is unwise to stress so.  There is a great deal at stake, truly, but "
      "the odds are in our favor.  There is much hope, as well.\"  Far'Nohl "
      "took a deep breath, and allowed his shoulders to drop."
      "\n"
      "     \"You are right, of course,\" he said.  \"Yes, I must remain calm. "
      "Bring me wine, and I will rest myself before battle.  You all, as "
      "well.  I have no doubt we shall need your magic before all is said and "
      "done.  Jala; perhaps a song is in order.\"\n"
      "     \"As you say, my lord.\"\n"
      "     \"Are you equal to the task?\" he asked her, genuine concern in "
      "his tone.\n"
      "     \"I am,\" she said.  The conviction in her voice was apparent.\n"
      "     \"And you?\" he asked both Faren and Kraanan.  \"Are you prepared "
      "for what is to come?\"\n"
      "     \"My mind is focused and ready,\" said Faren.  \"I will serve as "
      "best I can, all things considered.\"\n"
      "     \"As will I,\" said Kraanan.  Far'Nohl looked then to Shal'ille.\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"I will be ready, my lord,\" she said.  \"I promise you.  Have no "
      "fear.\"\n"
      "     \"Very well,\" he said.  \"I shall trust you all.  You have not "
      "let me down before.\"  He sincerely hoped they "
      "would not start now. He knew the severing of the Nexus had taken a "
      "great toll on all of them. They had felt it when it happened, and it "
      "weakened them considerably.  It had taken days for them to recover to "
      "the point where any of them could think straight.  Weeks before they "
      "were well enough to use magic again.\n"
      "     The four mages did as they were bid, taking rest in the shadow of "
      "the arms of the mountain.  They ate and meditated, focusing their "
      "energy and checking their connection to the Nexus.  All the same, "
      "Kraanan shared Far'Nohl's uneasiness, and never took his eyes off the "
      "mountain pass."
      "\n"
      "Far'Nohl sat with them, taking his own meal and sharpening his sword "
      "with a whetstone.  Jala tuned her harp, and sang to the soldiers as "
      "Far'Nohl had asked.\n"
      "     She was well known throughout the land for the power of her voice. "
      "It was said that she could weave her spells into her music, and often "
      "did.  The sound of her singing echoed off the walls of the gully, "
      "filling the hearts of all who heard it.  She started low, but her voice "
      "soon rose mightily.  To each person listening, the song was one of "
      "passion and glory, as well as restful easiness.  It calmed their fears, "
      "steeled their resolve, and strengthened their hearts.  Some even felt "
      "the strength flow into their muscle itself, lending them power for the "
      "battle ahead."

      "     Faren listened to her with rapt attention.  He always loved to "
      "hear her sing, and would always stop to listen whenever he overheard.  "
      "Her songs filled the halls of Castle Victoria constantly.  To his ears, "
      "there was no more beautiful sound in all the world.  He never had the "
      "courage to tell her, and she never knew how often he would stop all "
      "other activity to listen even if only for a note or two.\n"
      "     \"Quiet!\" barked Kraanan, suddenly.  Jala instantly stopped "
      "singing, and all eyes turned to follow his.  Far'Nohl stood beside him, "
      "both of them watching the pass now.\n"
      "     \"What do you see?\" asked Darien, coming up to join them.  No "
      "sooner had he asked, though, than Kraanan's messenger slowly came into "
      "view around the rocky outcrop."
      "\n\n\n"
      "She walked with her knees locked, as though dragging herself along by "
      "the last of her strength.  She stopped just beyond the entrance to the "
      "pass, and stared at them with seemingly dead eyes.\n"
      "     \"I do not like the look of this,\" said Far'Nohl.  He soon found "
      "that his suspicions were correct.  For a moment, the messenger stood "
      "staring at them.  Then suddenly, she slumped forward, landing face down "
      "in the dirt.  The feathered shaft of an arrow protruded from between "
      "her shoulders.\n"
      "     A murmur ran through the assembled fighters, and Jala gasped "
      "loudly.  Almost immediately, the first orc appeared.  He was green of "
      "skin, powerfully muscled and wore only a heavy loincloth.  Two leather "
      "straps crisscrossed on his chest, and he wore a rusted scimitar in his "
      "belt."
      "\n"
      "His black hair was cut in a dirty mohawk, and pulled back in a braid "
      "that ran down to his thighs.  His lower jaw jutted out menacingly, and "
      "sported two nasty pointed teeth long enough almost to reach his eyes.  "
      "In his hand he carried a gnarled longbow, and a leather quiver of "
      "arrows was slung across his back.  In his other hand, he carried a "
      "large, yellowing war horn.\n"
      "     He leapt up onto the rock, and stood stock still as he looked out "
      "over the army that was waiting for him.  He made no other movement, but "
      "simply watched as the soldiers moved to form ranks and ready their "
      "weapons.  A cruel smile crossed his face, and his shoulders shook as he "
      "chuckled to himself.  Shal'ille narrowed her eyes as she wondered what "
      "he found so amusing.\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"TO ARMS!\" called Darien, and he rushed to put on his helm and "
      "mount his horse.  His men were already forming a line of shields, but "
      "he barked his orders all the same.  Far'Nohl followed suit.\n"
      "     \"FORM A LINE!\" he called to his troops.  \"FORM A LINE!  SHIELDS "
      "IN FRONT!  SPEARS BEHIND!  ARCHERS TO THE REAR!\"\n"
      "     \"NOCK ARROWS!\" Kraanan called, following him.  \"PREPARE TO FIRE "
      "ON MY COMMAND!\"\n"
      "     The orc took up his war horn, and blew a single long blast.  Then "
      "the rest of the orcs appeared.  High on the cliff wall, far above the "
      "gully, they stood in lines looking down upon them.  They chanted and "
      "roared, shouting down curses and taunts in their guttural language.  "
      "They shook their scimitars, and banged them against their shields.  "
      "Many carried bows, as well."
      "\n"
      "Trolls stood amongst them, taller than the orcs, with mottled brown "
      "skin and covered in filth.  They bore no weapons, but were armed with "
      "claws and teeth as terrible as any sword or axe.  They roared "
      "wordlessly, and waved their long arms threateningly.\n"
      "     Faren and Jala moved to the front of the line, before the wall of "
      "shields.  The air around them began to swirl and writhe as they "
      "gathered their energy.  Kraanan drew his sword and moved to stand next "
      "to them, muttering incantations of his own.  He touched each shield as "
      "he passed, fortifying its bearer with what spells he could.\n"
      "     Shal'ille, however, did not move.  She stood in front of them all, "
      "completely exposed, but would not budge.  Her gaze moved from one end "
      "of the Orcish host to the other, studying each face one at a time."
      "\n"
      "She heard their shouts, and watched their display of force with her "
      "eyes still narrowed.  She did not gather her energy.\n"
      "     \"Shal'ille!\" Kraanan called to her.  \"Get back!\"\n"
      "     \"Stand back, Shal'ille!\" Far'Nohl called.  \"Form the line!\"\n"
      "      She did not move.\n"
      "     \"She's going to be killed,\" said Jala.  \"What is she doing?\" "
      "Without waiting for consent, Kraanan ran to her side.\n"
      "     \"Have you lost your sense, woman?\" he said, grabbing her arm.  "
      "She shook him off, and stayed where she was.\n"
      "     \"Something is wrong,\" she said.\n"
      "     \"I am aware of that,\" her husband agreed.  \"Come back to the "
      "line, and we'll fix it.\"\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"No,\" she said.  \"It's not what you think.  Something else.  "
      "Why haven't they attacked?\"\n"
      "     \"They surely will,\" said Kraanan.\n"
      "     \"No,\" Shal'ille said again.  \"Look!  They have bows.  They have "
      "arrows.  Why do they not shoot?\"\n"
      "     Kraanan did look.  She was right.  Every orc who carried a bow had "
      "yet to nock a single arrow.  They shouted and carried on, but they were "
      "not poised to fire.  Kraanan had been a soldier in the army of the "
      "Meridian all his life.  He had fought in dozens of battles.  He knew "
      "his strategy.  The orcs had the high ground.  Had it been his command, "
      "he would have sent arrows down amongst his enemies like rain by now.  "
      "Why had they not attacked?\n"
      "     \"Shal'ille!  Kraanan!\"  Far'Nohl's voice carried over the din of "
      "the shouting orcs.  \"What are you doing?\"\n"
      "\n"
      "     Before either of them could answer, a hot wind blew down from atop "
      "the cliffs.  It came hard and fast, striking their faces like a fiery "
      "fist.  The heat of it took their breath away.  Another gust followed, "
      "and then another.  Each was accompanied by a sound like the wind "
      "catching the sail of a ship.  A great beating upon the air, like an "
      "enormous canvas sheet.\n"
      "     Then terror gripped their hearts as another sound floated down "
      "upon the air.  A roar the likes of which none had heard in their "
      "lifetimes.  It was a deafening bellow, greater than any known beast.  "
      "It was an earthy sound, deep and rich.  Yet it seemed to mimic the roar "
      "of an inferno, as though the whole gully were suddenly aflame.  Its "
      "echo thundered in their ears long after the sound had faded.\n"
      "\n"
      "     A second roar rent the air, and the beast made itself seen.  The "
      "beating sound was that of its massive wings, drawing it up from behind "
      "the mountains.  Its sheer size was incredible; from snout to tail it "
      "was no less than a hundred feet long.  It had a long neck, and powerful "
      "legs ending in horrific claws, each the size of a grown man.  Enormous "
      "spines ran down its back from neck to tail.  Its long snout was filled "
      "with razor-sharp teeth, and two curved horns stuck out from behind its "
      "head.  Two hungry eyes stared down upon the waiting armies as it "
      "settled onto a perch above.  The sun glinted off the brilliant blue of "
      "its scaled skin, as though its very flesh had been polished to a "
      "sapphire shine.\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"No,\" the Ambassador whispered.\n"
      "     \"It cannot be,\" said Far'Nohl.\n"
      "     \"By the gods,\" Kraanan cursed.  The call ran unbidden through "
      "the ranks.\n"
      "     \"DRAGON!!\"\n"
      "     A second blast from the orc's horn was the signal, and the "
      "creature spread its great wings and dove from the cliff.  The shield "
      "wall broke before it was upon them, and chaos erupted throughout the "
      "ranks.  The blue dragon reared up at the last moment, skimming the "
      "grass with its belly.  It opened its toothy maw, and a great jet of "
      "flame burst forth, engulfing the soldiers as they fled.  Skin was "
      "singed to a crisp blackness.  Armor fused into a solid piece. "
      "Everywhere men and women screamed as they burned.\n"
      "     \"ARCHERS!\" Kraanan screamed, as he ran behind the beast.  "
      "\"LOOSE! LOOSE, DAMN YOU!\"\n"
      "\n"
      "     The archers had not yet broken rank, and followed his command.  A "
      "volley of arrows flew at the dragon.  It reared back, landing squarely "
      "before the archers, and the shafts bounced off its plated chest.  "
      "Hardly a scratch was left behind.  It lowered its head and bathed the "
      "archers in another jet of flame."

      "     Ambassador Darien struggled to maintain control.  Panic had "
      "gripped the Imperial troops as they watched the dragon destroy "
      "Far'Nohl's army.  They turned and ran back the way they had come, "
      "trampling over one another in their desperate bid to escape.  The "
      "dragon turned its attention on them, taking wing and showering them "
      "with fire from above.  It rose above the gully, circled back, and let "
      "loose upon them again.  The Ambassador's commands were lost in the roar "
      "of the flames, and his army fell where they stood, reduced to little "
      "more than ash.\n"
      "\n"
      "     A sudden blast of pure, white energy flew across the gully, "
      "striking the dragon's flank.  It wheeled at the sensation, roaring in "
      "confusion and pain.  Faren stood with his arm outstretched, a thin "
      "layer of frost formed on his fingers.  The spell had only succeeded in "
      "gaining the dragon's attention, however, and it turned angrily in his "
      "direction.  As it opened its jaws and spit fire at him, Faren raised "
      "his other hand.  The flames hit a wall of energy, and parted like a "
      "river against a boulder.  The dragon roared in bewilderment, but Faren "
      "stood unscathed.  Kraanan ran to stand by his side, as the dragon "
      "advanced upon them.\n"
      "     Far'Nohl seized the chance.  He ran past the dragon, shouting "
      "orders to his fleeing troops.  They were almost to the gates of Tos by "
      "the time he caught up to them.\n"

      "     At the edge of the field, Jala had begun to sing again.  This new "
      "tune was very "
      "different from the first.  It was deeper, stronger, and she poured her "
      "power into it in the hopes of inspiring courage in the fighters.  Away "
      "from the line of sight of the dragon, her song did the trick.  "
      "Emboldened, the soldiers lifted their swords and took up the cry.  "
      "Far'Nohl charged, and his troops followed. They charged round the bend, "
      "and back into the gully.\n"
      "     What archers remained loosed their arrows at the dragon's rear.  A "
      "few shafts caught in the membranes of its wings, but the rest glanced "
      "off.  As the creature turned to face the charging host, the spearmen "
      "caught it in the face.  Even so, their blows could not penetrate its "
      "thick scales."

      "It roared and reared and belched fire at them all.  It spun and swung "
      "its tail through their ranks like a club, and sent men flying.  It "
      "lashed out with its claws and bit with its teeth.\n"
      "     Ambassador Darien had managed to regain some control over his "
      "troops, as well.  He ordered a charge, and they joined the others.  "
      "They fared no better, however, and the dragon's ire destroyed them just "
      "as easily.  Darien landed a blow with his sword on the dragon's front "
      "leg.  It swung its neck round, and roared in his face, startling his "
      "mount.  It reared, and the Ambassador fell from the saddle.  He rolled "
      "just in time to see the dragon clamp its jaws over the horse, throw "
      "back its head, and swallow the poor animal in a single gulp.\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"We have to lead it away,\" Shal'ille cried.  \"We have to draw "
      "it from this place.\"\n"
      "     \"How do you propose we do that?\" Kraanan demanded, but he was "
      "already "
      "calculating possible strategies in his head.  Faren, however, did not "
      "wait for their word.  He raised his hand, bringing forth another ball "
      "of cold energy, ready to loose upon the dragon.  He never got the "
      "chance.\n"
      "     The orc had sounded his horn once again.  The three of them turned "
      "in time to see a hundred orcs rounding the bend from the narrow pass "
      "one by one, running full speed with their weapons held high.  Overhead, "
      "their archers loosed a volley of arrows into the air.  The shafts "
      "reached their height, then turned back to the earth to fall amongst the "
      "two already scattered armies."
      "\n"
      "Men screamed and fell.  Others ran again.  Kraanan raised his shield "
      "against the onslaught, but Shal'ille was faster.  She threw a hand "
      "above her head, and the arrows struck the air over them, falling "
      "harmlessly to the ground at their feet.\n"
      "     By then, the charging horde was upon them.  Faren loosed his spell "
      "into their front line, knocking several to the ground.  Kraanan lifted "
      "his sword, and cried aloud as he charged into them.  Two he felled with "
      "his first blow, then proceeded to cut them down one by one as they "
      "passed.  Two more fell upon Shal'ille with spear and scimitar, but she "
      "turned their blows aside with a wave of her hand.  No matter how they "
      "struck, they could not penetrate her magical shield.\n"
      "\n"
      "     Far'Nohl saw the orcs coming across the field.\n"
      "     \"RALLY TO ME!\" he cried, and those closest to him followed.  The "
      "dragon was temporarily forgotten as they ran to meet the Orcish host.  "
      "Some Imperial troops followed them, as well, and the armies collided in "
      "the middle of the field.  The air rang with the sound of steel on steel "
      "and the cries of the dying.  The green grass ran red with the blood of "
      "men, and purple with the blood of orcs.\n"
      "     Far'Nohl fought as hard as any, cutting his way through their "
      "ranks with his sword.  He was soon joined by Kraanan, who had lost his "
      "shield but replaced it with a mace.  With a weapon in each hand he "
      "stood back to back with his liege, and any who dared to challenge them "
      "soon came to regret that decision.\n"
      "\n"
      "     Still most of their army was on the run.  The dragon took wing "
      "again, and gave pursuit past the Main Gate of Tos, and followed many "
      "fleeing soldiers deep into the Twisted Wood beyond.  It soon "
      "disappeared behind the line of trees, and was gone.\n"
      "     Jala came running back into the gully.  She fought for every "
      "breath as she struggled to keep her song going, but it was no use.  Her "
      "strength was utterly spent, and her magic was no good to her if she "
      "could not sing.  All around her she could see the courage of their "

      "Faren.  So intent in her search was she that she did not see the orc "
      "coming up behind her until she was caught in the back by a sharp kick "
      "of his boot.  Jala was knocked off her feet, the wind gone from her "
      "lungs.  She hit the ground hard, and rolled, looking up into the face "
      "of her assailant.  The huge orc stared down at her with one menacing "
      "eye (the other was missing, and the socket covered by an ugly scar), "
      "and smiled a smile that was missing several sharp teeth. He raised his "
      "scimitar, ready to bring it down upon her; and suddenly shook as lines "
      "of shocking blue energy wracked his body."
      "\n"
      "He convulsed violently, dropping his blade, then fell aside dead as "
      "tendrils of smoke rose from his singed flesh.\n"
      "     Jala looked to where he had been standing, and Faren stood there "
      "now with his hand outstretched where he had zapped the orc.  He lowered "
      "it to help her to her feet, and she took it gratefully.  He turned as "
      "if to lead her out of the battle, but she pulled him close and into a "
      "deep, passionate kiss. The first they had ever shared.\n"
      "\n"
      "     \"Was now really the time for that?\" he said, after they broke "
      "the kiss.\n"
      "     \"It has waited long enough,\" she told him, and together they "
      "turned back to face the oncoming horde.\n"
      "     As they did so, a small group of orcs formed a rank of their own "
      "in the middle of the fray.  These few carried no weapons and wore no "
      "armor.  They were dressed in ragged brown robes, tied with rope around "
      "their waists.  In their hands they each carried a gnarled wooden "
      "staff.  As one, they began to chant."

      "quickly, but the second was ready for him.  He raised a clawed hand in "
      "Kraanan's face, and the warrior stopped dead in his tracks.  He tried "
      "in vain to move his feet, but only succeeded in leaving long divots in "

      "followed them as they ran into the line of trees that framed the road, "
      "and regrouped in the grassy field of the Flatlands.\n"
      "     Faren and Jala were the last to break through.  He paused then, "

      "     The army had gathered along the banks of the River Ille, which "
      "flowed lazily through the Flatlands.  The water ran red as injured "

      "the grass to catch their breath. A few had already begun to strip their "

      "figure in golden robes stepped forward into the open.\n"

      "their wayward forces and track the movement of the orcs.  The rest "
      "moved into the city, and were quickly given quarter in every available "
      "inn and personal residence.  Healers were called for, and soon they "
      "bustled about the city tending to the wounded.  By nightfall, several "
      "soldiers had died of their injuries, and the nurses reported that there "
      "may yet be many more.\n"
      "     Far'Nohl called his Council, and Ambassador Darien joined them.  "
      "The royal chambers were located on the North Side, overlooking the main "
      "square and Barloque's famous water clock.  The building was of gray "
      "stone, and was as imposing as it was beautiful.  Steps led up to a pair "
      "of ornate, green, iron doors with bronze handles."
      "\n"
      "The porch was rimmed by a cast iron fence, and patterned after "
      "ivy-wrapped spears.  Four short statues stood in raised alcoves to "
      "either side, chiseled from granite into the shapes of the Empire's "
      "greatest heroes.  A splendid motif adorned the facsade of the vaulted "
      "roof, depicting the Empire's prolific history.\n"
      "     The inside was no less splendid.  Brownstone walls rose high to a "
      "polished wooden ceiling.  Elaborate tapestries hung on either side of "
      "the doors, and more along the walls.  Beneath each tapestry, a brazier "
      "burned with delightful warmth, filling the room with flickering orange "
      "light.  A staircase led up to the Council floor, here ceiling-high "
      "windows overlooked the docks and the Great Ocean beyond.  The "
      "tapestries here bore the standards of Meridian's most prominent noble "
      "houses and guilds, signs of their loyalty to the Prince Regent.\n"
      "\n"
      "     A table had been laid with refreshments.  A wheel of cheese, "
      "grapes, fresh bread, and ale had been provided for the Council.  It all "
      "lay untouched, for none had any appetite.  Save for Riija, who happily "
      "plucked a few grapes off the bunch and poured himself a flagon of the "
      "ale.\n"
      "     Ambassador Darien stood by a brazier, staring into the flames and "
      "wringing his hands restlessly.  Far'Nohl took a seat at the table with "
      "Riija, and eyed the food but could not bring himself to eat.  Faren and "
      "Jala were sitting together by the farthest window, watching the waves "
      "of the ocean lap against the docks.\n"
      "     The iron doors swung open, and Kraanan and Shal'ille entered the "
      "hall.  Far'Nohl rose as they ascended the steps to join them.\n"

      "Kraanan?\"\n"
      "     \"They have, my lord,\" said Kraanan.  \"The orcs have moved the "

      "was there that the crowd had gathered.  By the light of their torches, "
      "Far'Nohl could see anger and fear on their faces.  They made way for "
      "him as he pushed toward the front of the mob.  There he found Kraanan, "
      "Faren, Jala, Riija, and Qor looking out across the sea.  There, even "
      "now shrinking into the distance, was a line of tall ships at full "
      "mast.  The ships of the Empire.\n"
      "     \"Ambassador Darien,\" said Kraanan, and he spat.  \"Bloody "

      "     \"He; left?\" said Far'Nohl, in disbelief.  \"He just left?!\"\n"
      "     \"With the whole of his army,\" said Riija.  \"Every last one.  "
      "They stole onto their ships while we slept, and now they're gone.\"\n"
      ""
      "     \"Did you expect any less?\" Qor asked, smirking.  \"You did not "
      "truly believe he would wait until morning?  He made his position quite "
      "clear.  Postponing our council would only serve to delay the "
      "inevitable. The only thing I find surprising is that he waited as long "
      "as he did.\"  Far'Nohl's anger flared then.\n"
       "    \"COWARDS!!\" he called after the ships.  His hands balled into "
      "fists, and his face grew red with hate.  He screamed again, and threw "
      "rocks off the dock.  \"CURSE YOU, DARIEN!  YOU TREACHEROUS SCUM!  YOU "
      "AND ALL THE EMPIRE!  DAMN YOU, ALL!\"\n"
      "     \"My lord,\" said Jala quickly, rushing to his side.  \"You "
      "must stop. Please.  The people.\"  But the damage had been done.\n"

      "     \"The Empire has abandoned us!\"  The cry came from somewhere deep "
      "in the crowd.  Others quickly followed.\n"
      "     \"We are all doomed!\"\n"
      "     \"We're going to die!\"\n"
      "     \"Tis the end!  The end of all!\"\n"
      "     \"What shall we do now?\" asked Jala.  Far'Nohl said nothing.  He "
      "stared out over the waves, watching the Empire's ships vanishing toward "
      "the horizon.  Soon, even their dimmest silhouettes could not be seen "
      "against the backdrop of the night sky.  Only the reflection of the moon "
      "was left to be seen upon the water.\n"
      "     The crowd began to grow more unruly.  Cries of panic erupted "
      "everywhere, and Far'Nohl feared they would soon riot.  With their "
      "connection to the Nexus already severed, the people had no other means "
      "of escape."
      ""
      "The only other way out of that country was through the "
      "mountains, but that would lead them right into the hands of their "
      "enemies.  They were well and truly trapped.\n"
      "     \"To my chambers,\" he finally said.  Then he turned to address "
      "the crowd.  \"Silence!  Everyone listen, please!  I know that you are "
      "afraid.  It is true the Empire has abandoned you, but I shall not.  "
      "This war is not yet over.  As long as there is strength in our blood, "
      "we shall stand against those who would murder and destroy us.  My "
      "Council and I shall convene immediately to form a strategy.  I assure "
      "you, that by first light, as will know what to do.\"\n"

      "words, but they went nonetheless.  There was not one among them, "
      "however, who did not cast a look at Far'Nohl as they did so.  Some were "
      "angry.  Otherwise mistrustful.  Some scared.  Others pleading.  A few "
      "even looked as though they were ready to laugh in his face.  Men "
      "scowled, and women clutched their children in their arms.\n"
      "     \"You have not given us a great deal of time,\" said Kraanan, as "
      "he watched the crowd depart.  \"We may not be able to deliver by "
      "morning.\"\n"
      "     \"I am aware,\" said Far'Nohl, grinding his teeth.  His anger was "
      "ebbing slowly, but it was still there.  If he could, he would bring "
      "each and every one of those ships back and murder the Ambassador for "
      "this treachery."

      "He almost smiled as he imagined running a sword "

      "dry.\n"
      "     \"Are you sure?\" he asked.\n"
      "     \"I am,\" she said.  \"And hurry.  Time is of the essence.\"\n"

      "realms,\" said Qor, pouring a red liquid into the lake.  \"Be present "
      "in my circle now, and bring your vibrant energies so our people shall "
      "have courage. Welcome, Fire.\"\n"
      "     \"I call to you O Powers of the East, from your watery "
      "realms,\" Faren said.  From his bottle there came a thick, blue liquid, "
      "which appeared to be boiling.  \"Be present in my circle now, and bring "
      "your calming energies so that this land will know peace.  Welcome, "
      "Water.\"\n"

      "     The four swirls of light were now joined together as one, and it "
      "spiraled inward until it surrounded Jala.  As the energy touched her, "
      "she sang ever louder.  She threw her head back, calling out her song to "
      "the sky, and the energy swirled around her and rose into the air.  High "
      "above, against the gray light of the morning, the light began to "
      "spread, forming a dome of pure mana energy over their heads.  It spread "
      "across the sky, making its way to the edge of the mountains and the "
      "borders of the Meridian.\n"
      "     It was then that something went wrong.\n"
      "     Suddenly, Kraanan doubled over.  A great pain wracked his body, "
      "and he fell to his knees in the water.  Shal'ille turned, her attention "
      "drawn to the anguished cry of her husband.  His expression changed from "
      "one of painful torment to utter astonishment, as his hands slowly "
      "hardened and turned to stone.  It spread up his arms, over his "
      "shoulders, across his chest."
      ""
      "Shal'ille watched in helpless horror as "
      "it engulfed Kraanan completely, turning his flesh to granite.  His "
      "cries were silenced as it spread up his neck and over his face.  No "
      "sooner was the transformation complete, than the stone cracked, and the "
      "once mighty Kraanan crumbled to dust.\n"
      "     All eyes turned as Shal'ille's cry of grief and dismay overpowered "
      "Jala's song.  She broke the circle, rushing to the spot where Kraanan "
      "had stood.  Yet even as she did so, the wind whipped about her "
      "violently, and all at once she became a part of it.  Her own anguished "
      "form turned white as a cloud, and it dissipated in the air like a fog "
      "on the breeze.  Her last cries vanished with the last wisps of her "
      "form, and then she too was gone.\n"
      "     \"Riija!\" Far'Nohl demanded.  \"What is happening?\"\n"
      "     \"I-I; I do not know, my lord.\"  He looked desperately at the "
      "scroll, hoping for an answer.  Then he heard Jala scream.\n"
      ""
      "     Her song stopped short, cut off suddenly as the wind was pushed "
      "from her lungs.  From between her shoulders protruded the handle of a "
      "blood-soaked dagger, and Qor was holding the hilt.  She smirked evilly "
      "as she pulled the weapon out, letting Jala's lifeless body fall into "
      "the water. Instantly, Faren was at her side.  No words did he speak, "
      "but held Jala in his arms, clutching her to his chest and kissing her "
      "brow.  Even as he did so, the light engulfed her, taking her with it "
      "into the sky.  Soon she too had vanished, becoming one with the energy "
      "she had been channeling."

      "     \"Why?\" he said, throwing himself at her again.  She dodged, and "

      "you?!\"\n"
      "     \"How could I stop this madness?\" she asked, arrogantly.  \"The "
      "only way that would make any of you understand.  Don't you see?  "
      "Kraanan and Shal'ille sacrificed themselves needlessly.  The end is "
      "coming for Meridian and the Empire.  It cannot be stopped.  There is no "

      "\"It was you. You betrayed us all.  You made them join you.  You led "

      ""
      "     \"Of course!\" she admitted.  \"I saw the folly of our campaign as "
      "soon as I laid eyes upon their host.  I knew we had no hope, so I did "
      "what I needed to save myself.  The soldiers under my command did no "
      "less.  You are wrong on only one point, Faren.  I did not surrender to "
      "the orcs; I command them.\"\n"
      "     \"WHAT?!\"\n"
      "     \"I am not theirs,\" she said.  \"They are mine!  Do you think any "
      "of their wizards were a match for me.  So great is my power they "
      "dropped to their knees at my feet and called me 쁤oddess'.  It is my "

      "     \"She perverted the ritual,\" said Riija.\n"
      "     \"How?\" asked Far'Nohl.  His anger was no less than Faren's, but "
      "he dared not act.  Despite Qor's interference, the ritual was still "
      "going and the magic was still at work.\n"
      ""
      "     \"The spell requires that those casting it surrender a portion of "
      "their life energy,\" Riija explained.  \"She simply did not give "
      "enough.  The ritual must have taken what it needed from the others to "
      "sustain the spell.\"\n"
      "     \"Will it still work?\"\n"
      "     \"It may,\" said Riija, \"but at what cost?\"\n"

      "his eyes as he looked on her with pure and utter hatred.\n"
      "     \"I will kill you for this,\" he said.  \"I WILL KILL YOU!\"\n"
      "     In a flash his own sword was drawn, and Qor only just moved away "
      "in time.  Around and around the lake they danced, in and out of the "
      "roiling energies.  They dodge and parried each other in a dance of rage "
      "and power.  Yet Faren proved the more aggressive, and Qor soon knew she "
      "stood no chance."
      ""
      "Her expression of arrogance turned to one of fear, as "
      "Faren's onslaught grew ever more ferocious.\n"
      "     As last his blade hit home, striking across Qor's chest.  The "
      "wound would have been deep, and certainly fatal.  At the blade's touch, "
      "however, Qor too vanished.  Her body erupted into violent flames, "
      "dancing along her form, and she disappeared in the rising black smoke.  "
      "Her last cries were cries of pain and laughter.\n"
      "     Faren watched as her flames burned out.  His grief overtook him, "
      "and he fell to his knees.  Tears streamed down his face.  He wept for "
      "what he had done.  He wept for his friends.  He wept for Jala.  As the "
      "tears came, the streaks they left upon his face ran deep.  Great "
      "runnels appeared down his neck and across his shoulders.  He felt the "
      "change come, and welcomed it.  He looked to the sky, watching the dome "
      "of energy continue to spread.\n"
      "     \"Soon,\" he said to himself.  \"Soon, my love, we shall be "
      "together again.\"\n"
      ""
      "     With that, his body took the form of water and dissolved to join "
      "the lake around him.  As his form vanished, the shaft of light rose to "
      "join the dome, and disappeared.  The light in the sky lingered for a "
      "moment, then faded, giving way to the bright blue of pure morning.\n"
      "     Over the lake, there was silence.\n"
      "     \"What happened?\" Far'Nohl finally asked.  \"Did it work?\"\n"
      "     For a moment, Riija said nothing.  Then his shoulders began to "
      "quiver, and a smile crossed his face.  All at once he threw his head "
      "back and burst into maniacal laughter.\n"
      "     \"What is this?\" Far'Nohl asked.  \"What has come over you?  "
      "Answer me!\"\n"
      "     \"It worked,\" Riija said, still laughing.  \"I assure you, my "
      "lord, this land is now safe.  The Barrier has been restored.\"\n"
      "     \"And what of the others?  Are they; are they dead?\"\n"
      ""
      "     \"Oh,\" said Riija, \"now that is the real question, isn't it?\"  "
      "With that, he turned away from Far'Nohl, letting the scroll fall to the "
      "ground.\n"
      "     \"Riija!\" Far'Nohl called after him, watching him stride off "
      "toward the road.  \"Riija!  Where are you going?  Why do you not "
      "answer me?  Riija!\"\n"
      "     Riija only kept on laughing, ignoring the prince, and disappearing "
      "around the bend in the trees.  Far'Nohl ran after him, yet as he "
      "rounded the same bend, Riija was nowhere to be found.  The last echoes "
      "of his laughter could be heard, but soon they too were gone.\n"
      "     Far'Nohl returned to the lake.  He plucked the scroll from the "
      "grass, and shook off the morning dew.  Yet, as he looked at the aging "
      "parchment, to his great astonishment the page was now blank.  He looked "
      "out across the lake, slowly shaking his head.\n"
      "     \"What have I done?\" he said aloud.  \"What have I done?\" "
