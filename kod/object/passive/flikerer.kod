Flickerer is PassiveObject

% This originally was items that cycled through an animation sequence, like
%  fire, etc.  None of these objects were actually flagged as flickerers.
% With the introduction of dynamic lighting the new graphics engine, this
%  now also deals with objects that give off light.
