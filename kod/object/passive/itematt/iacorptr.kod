ItemAttCorpsePointer is ItemAttribute

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  The job of corpsepointer is simply to point at the monster that 
%    formerly 'carried' the loot, allowing whoever killed the monster
%    to get first crack at the loot.  
% 
%  Form is: 
%
%      [IA_CORPSEPOINTER, $, oCorpse]
%   
%       oCorpse :: the corpse that the pointer is remembering
%
%  A final word: this pointer will stick around for only 20 seconds
%     after a kill, then it will delete itself, removing it from the
%     item's plItem_attribute's list.
