ItemAttDurable is ItemAttribute

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  This item gets it's max_hit_points multiplied by three, at the 
%  point when the item is first 'enchanted' (usually on or near
%  the creation of the object.
%
%  Another effect can change the durability factor, by giving a value
%  for state1 when the itematt is applied.  If none is given, the
%  default of 300 is used (or three times the current Hp of the 
%  item).   Note that this value is not stored, because this value
%  is completely unimportant after the value of max_hit_points 
%  changes.
%
%  Form is:
%
%      [IA_DURABLE]
