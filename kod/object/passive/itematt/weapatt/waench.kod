WeapAttEnchanted is WeaponAttribute

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  This weapon attribute merely flags the weapon as having the 'magic'
%		flag flipped - some monsters are susceptible to magic attacks.
% 
%  Form is: 
%
%   	[WA_ENCHANTED, timer ]
%	
%       timer::the length of time, from 1 to 25 realtime hours,
%			that the enchantment lasts (depending on spell factors).
%
%  Note that if a weapon ends up permanently holy or unholy, then this
%       attribute is no longer necessary, since the attack values flags
%       in weapon stores this information.  This information is only
%       stored here so that eventually, it may be forgotten.
