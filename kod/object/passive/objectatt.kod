%  Object Attributes
%
%  Object attributes are a new modern system for special modifications.
%     These attributes are themselves objects, and are attached to their host
%     object in a list, plObject_attributes. It's up to the object to call them.
%
%  Unlike item attributes, these are not limited solely to items, but will
%     probably be mostly item-focused. Examples of other uses could be as 
%     modifications to monsters, players, or even rooms.
