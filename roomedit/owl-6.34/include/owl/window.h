/// \class TWindow
// ~~~~~ ~~~~~~~
/// TWindow, derived from TEventHandler and TStreamableBase, provides
/// window-specific behavior and encapsulates many functions that control window
/// behavior and specify window creation and registration attributes.
/// 
/// TWindow is a generic window that can be resized and moved. You can construct an
/// instance of TWindow, though normally you use TWindow as a base for your
/// specialized window classes. In general, to associate and disassociate a TWindow
/// object with a window element, you need to follow these steps:
/// - 1.	Construct an instance of a TWindow.
/// - 2.	Call Create or Execute, which creates the interface element (HWND) and then
/// calls SetupWindow, which calls the base SetupWindow for normal processing, which
/// in turn involves
/// - Creating the HWindow and any child HWindows.
/// - Calling TransferData to setup the transfer of data between the
/// parent and child windows.
/// - 3.	To destroy the interface element, choose one of the following actions,
/// depending on your application:
/// - Call Destroy to destroy the interface element unconditionally.
/// - Call CloseWindow, which calls CanClose to test if it is OK to
/// destroy the interface element.
/// - 4.	There are two ways to destroy the interface object:
/// - If the object has been new'd, use delete.
/// - If the object has not been new'd, the compiler automatically
/// destructs the object.
/// 
/// The ObjectWindows destroy process consists of two parts: (1) call Destroy to
/// destroy the interface element and (2) then delete the C++ object. However, it is
/// perfectly valid to call Destroy on the interface element without deleting the
/// C++ object and then to call Create at a later time to re-create the window.
/// Because it is also valid to construct a C++ window object on the stack or as an
/// aggregated member, the Destroy function cannot assume it should delete the C++
/// object.
/// 
/// The user-generated WM_CLOSE event handler, EvClose, also causes a C++ object to
/// be deleted by passing the this pointer to the application. The C++ object is
/// deleted automatically because the EvClose event frequently occurs in response to
/// a user action, and this is the most convenient place for the deletion to take
/// place. Later, when it's safe to do so, the application then deletes the window
/// pointer. Because the stack often contains selectors that refer to the addresses
/// of objects that may become invalid during the delete process, it is not safe to
/// delete the this pointer while events are still being processed. If the addresses
/// become invalid, they could cause trouble when they are reloaded from the stack.
/// 
/// TWindow is the base class for all window classes, including TFrameWindow,
/// TControl, TDialog, and TMDIChild. The ObjectWindows hierarchy diagram shows the
/// many classes that are derived from TWindow.
