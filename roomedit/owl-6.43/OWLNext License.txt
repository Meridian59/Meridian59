OWLNext License


1. Prerequisites

OWLNext is based on the Object Windows Library (OWL) which is copyrighted software owned by Embarcadero Technologies (acquired from Borland Software Corporation as part of its CodeGear division in 2008). Therefore, you need a license to one of Embarcadero's C++Builder products, or an earlier legacy product, such as Borland C++, that gives you rights to use OWL 5.0.

See our project web site for more information on how to obtain an OWL license.

2. OWLNext Specific License 

OWLNext consists of modifications and additions (collectively called PATCHES) to the original OWL source code. These PATCHES are the property of the respective contributors to OWLNext and are licensed for general use in accordance with the OSI Approved zlib/libpng License. Note that this license only applies to the PATCHES. The full OWLNext source code (the patched software) is further restricted by the OWL license; refer to your OWL license for details.
