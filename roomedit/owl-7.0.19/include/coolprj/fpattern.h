 * fpattern.h
 *  Functions for matching filename patterns to filenames.
 *
 * Usage
 *  Filename patterns are composed of regular (printable) characters which
 *  may comprise a filename as well as special pattern matching characters:
 *
 *      .       Matches a period (.).
 *          Note that a period in a filename is not treated any
 *          differently than any other character.
 *
 *      ?       Any.
 *          Matches any single character except '/' or '\'.
 *
 *      *       Closure.
 *          Matches zero or more occurences of any characters other
 *          than '/' or '\'.
 *          Leading '*' characters are allowed.
 *
 *      SUB     Substitute (^Z).
 *          Similar to '*', this matches zero or more occurences of
 *          any characters other than '/', '\', or '.'.
 *          Leading '^Z' characters are allowed.
 *
 *      [ab]    Set.
 *          Matches the single character 'a' or 'b'.
 *          If the dash '-' character is to be included, it must
 *          immediately follow the opening bracket '['.
 *          If the closing bracket ']' character is to be included,
 *          it must be preceded by a quote '`'.
 *
 *      [a-z]   Range.
 *          Matches a single character in the range 'a' to 'z'.
 *          Ranges and sets may be combined within the same set of
 *          brackets.
 *
 *      [!R]    Exclusive range.
 *          Matches a single character not in the range 'R'.
 *          If range 'R' includes the dash '-' character, the dash
 *          must immediately follow the caret '!'.
 *
 *      !       Not.
 *          Makes the following pattern (up to the next '/') match
 *          any filename except those what it would normally match.
 *
 *      /       Path separator (UNIX and DOS).
 *          Matches a '/' or '\' pathname (directory) separator.
 *          Multiple separators are treated like a single
 *          separator.
 *          A leading separator indicates an absolute pathname.
 *
 *      \       Path separator (DOS).
 *          Same as the '/' character.
 *          Note that this character must be escaped if used within
 *          string constants ("\\").
 *
 *      \       Quote (UNIX).
 *          Makes the next character a regular (nonspecial)
 *          character.
 *          Note that to match the quote character itself, it must
 *          be quoted.
 *          Note that this character must be escaped if used within
 *          string constants ("\\").
 *
 *      `       Quote (DOS).
 *          Makes the next character a regular (nonspecial)
 *          character.
 *          Note that to match the quote character itself, it must
 *          be quoted.
 *
 *  Upper and lower case alphabetic characters are considered identical,
 *  i.e., 'a' and 'A' match each other.
 *  (What constitutes a lowercase letter depends on the current locale
 *  settings.)
 *
 *  Spaces and control characters are treated as normal characters.
 *
 * Examples
 *  The following patterns in the left column will match the filenames in
 *  the middle column and will not match filenames in the right column:
 *
 *      Pattern Will Match          Will Not Match
