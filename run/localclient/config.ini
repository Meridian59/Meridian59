Configuration file for Meridian 59


This file enables the new custom configuration settings and key bindings.  The [config] section contains the following options:

initialized:  Set this to false (or delete this file) to have Meridian create a default config.ini file for you
classickeybindings:  Set this to true to enable key bindings identical to the old Meridian client (later key bindings are ignored)
invertmouse:  Set to true to invert mouselook's y-axis
mouselookxscale/mouselookyscale:  Sets the mouse sensitivity.  Accepts any value from 1 to 30
quickchat:  Set to true to have all alphabetic keys go instantly to chat (any later key binding using an alphabetic key will be ignored)
alwaysrun:  Set to true to avoid having to hold the run key (default: shift) to run
dynamiclighting:  Set to true to enable dynamic lighting.  Setting this to false may increase performance on some systems

softwarerenderer:  Set to true to force the client to run in software graphics mode

rendererfailedonce:  NOT USER EDITABLE.  The client will set this to true when it determines that your hardware/driver cannot run Meridian in Direct3D.  This will prevent any further error messages until you either delete this file or change video cards/drivers

The [key] section represents your key bindings.  It uses the following format:

<action>=<key>[+<modifier>]

Where <key> can be any of the following keys:

a-z, mouse0-mouse5, pageup, pagedown, home, end, delete, enter, space, up, down, left, right, esc, tab, ',', ';', '.', ''', '[', or ']' 

And the optional <modifier> can be: shift, alt, ctrl, or any

Use 'any' for keys that you would like to work inclusively with all other actions.  Some good examples of this are the 'attack' and 'mouselooktoggle' actions
