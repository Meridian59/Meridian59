# Packages for Meridian 59 Updates
#
# Each line:
#   <filename.zip> <sequencenumber> <destination> [<zipsize>]
#
# Where:
#   <sequencenumber> increases as new packages are added to this file.
#                    Compared against client's meridian.ini [Miscellaneous] Download=number.
#
#   <destination> is a coded number for different subdirectories in client.
#                   0 = retrieve file to client .\resource
#                   4 = retrieve file to client .\
#                   8 = retrieve file to Windows directory (e.g., C:\WINDOWS)
#                  12 = retrieve file to Windows System directory (e.g., C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM)
#                  16 = retrieve file to client .\help
#                  20 = retrieve file to client .\mail
#                  24 = retrieve file to client .\ads
#                 Special:
#                  +1 = delete file (e.g., 21 = delete from .\mail)
#                  +32 = guest clients should download (obsolete)
#                 Actually, zip files are retrieved to .\download, then unzipped to location.
#
#   <zipsize> is in bytes, optional, used by the client to estimate download time
#
#
# For each update, a CD-ROM of the already-updated client is delivered.
# Those CD-ROMs include meridian.ini files that have [Miscellaneous] Download= set to the last
# package sequence number here.  Since the CD-ROM is usually made before this file is made,
# the sequence numbers here are manipulated to match.  For example, if the CD-ROM has
# Download=3000, then this file should have the last update set to 2999.  When a non-CD-ROM
# client finishes downloading package 2999, then it will set its Download=3000 to anticipate
# the next time.
#
# As a convenience to the user, each package should be about 1Mb or less.  Failed downloads
# will be retried on later attempts.
#
# Keep a record of what each file contains.  Keep items that may be replaced later in separate
# archives.  This allows us to delete old archive files so that users do not have to re-download
# files that will be replaced by later downloads later.  This saves on bandwidth, too!
